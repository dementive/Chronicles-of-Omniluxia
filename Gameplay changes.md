# Magic:

- Laws for magic that determine if it is banned or allowed in the nation

- occasionally characters will gain a become_mage ambition when growing up and gain one of several mage traits on completion or fail entirely

- after completing the ambition and gaining the mage_trait a character that is between the ages of 16-60 will get a mage 'specialization' (sorceror/wizard/druid/warlock/cleric) or just stay as a regular mage

- highly skilled mages will be able to get the archmage_trait and are masters of all specializations

- mage characters in nations with magic banned will have events to do things like cause trouble, move to nations with magic allowed, advocate for law changes, create new mage pops, etc...

- If magic is not banned:
	- mage pops will be allowed to grow, otherwise they will have no desired ratio
	- countries will be able to hire 1 'court wizard' that is able to cast different 'spells' with various special effects depending on what kind of mage trait they have
	- spells will be cast from a menu that opened with in the government view next to your court wizard
	- the spells that are available depend on what kind of mage trait the court wizard has, the effectiveness of each spell depends on their 'mage experience' (attempting to cast spells will give them more experience) and their stats/traits
	- There are 4 different tiers for each spell, each with different levels of effectiveness and difficulty to perform
