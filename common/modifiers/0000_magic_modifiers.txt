# IMPORTANT NOTE: THESE ARE NOT REAL MODIFIERS!
# These modifiers actually have no effect on the game at all. They are used to make the player think there are real magic modifiers...even though there really aren't.
# Any and all usage of these modifiers can be found in scripted_effects/0000_magic_effects.txt
