#This file contains AI acceptance factors (actually terms), aka. "diplo chance" in code.

#Existing factors can be arbitrarily multiplied (scale) and added to (offset).
#In general, we prefer adding to base factor.
#Hardcoded factors can be removed by scaling by 0.
#Subject specific demanding become subject are located in common/subject_types diplo_chance blocks.

#In some cases these overlap some defines since this file is comparatively new,
#the intent is to add future constants here rather than new defines where possible.
#Since hardcoded factors are scaled by these and may change, make sure to double-check
#your scaling on a new version. We will try to export scaling to this file gradually.

#In the future we might add support for entirely custom scriptable factors like EU4 has,
#or otherwise make the factors freely exchangable. There may always be a degree of
#hardcoding due to performance however.
