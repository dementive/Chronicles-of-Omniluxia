Most prominent #E #Y Aldic#!#! magicians often become renown healers or diplomats, with the latter often using their abilities to manipulate the masses or opponents for their gain.\n\nMost of these men are of the #E #Y Illusionist#!#! class, who devote themselves to the manipulation of the mind and soul. Tricksters by nature, illusionists have been historically persecuted and their research restricted because of the great damage they do to society. Able to manipulate their way into high political positions and manipulate great generals into retreating prematurely, magicians of this class are some of the most powerful in #E #Y Omniluxia#!#!.\n\nThose who choose the humble #E #Y Cleric#!#! class are typically the exact opposite of the often malevolent #E #Y Illusionists#!#!. Choosing to use their abilities for good, these clerics try to manipulate the flesh and mind of conscious races in order to heal them, with the most powerful #E #Y Clerics#!#! able to cure fatal diseases and even improve the natural abilities of their patient. However, there are those who abuse such powers in order to cause harm rather than cure others.\n\nLooking through the spells available to them, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] must choose what to learn."
