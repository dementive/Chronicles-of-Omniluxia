01_seekers_task_1: "The Northern Hebric Crusade"
01_seekers_task_1_DESC: "One of the earliest passages in the #E Annals of the Grand Inquisitor#!, a history of the Seeker Faith and its founding mythos, describes the heroic wars waged between the earliest Seekers and the dwarven town dwellers of Celtica in an account known as #E The Northern Hebric Crusade#!.\n\nAccording to the Annals, once the #Y Way That Is True#! began to be taught in the valleys of #E Celtica#!, a few pious Kings surrendered their authority to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName], who then led the people to attack the decadent #E Hebric#! dwarves that lived in the northern mountains."

01_seekers_task_3: "Consolidating The Councils"
01_seekers_task_3_DESC: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName] finds its power to be diluted, too decentralized, and that is because there are too many Grand Masters ruling independently - there should be only one, and it must be [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Now that the dwarven abomination has been driven out from among us, we must quell dissenting voices and unite the various Councils under the banner of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
