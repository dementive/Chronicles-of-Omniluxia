01_seekers: "Seekers of the Way"
01_seekers_DESCRIPTION: "Almost seventy years ago, a shepherd that was known as #E Cerwain the Hermit#! was tending to his flocks when the ground began to tremble and a soft light enveloped the frightened old man. Fearing for his life, Cerwain felt a voice speak from inside him with a simple message; 'Fear not.'\n\nIn the years to come, the encounter that the hermit had on the Hill Ganara outside the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3502').GetName] in #E Celtica#! would become known as the #E Revelation#!, and the #E Message#! that was revealed to that simple farmer would become a riddle destined to topple ancient dynasties from their thrones, scattering the mighty nations and causing brother to kill brother...\n\n'Seek nothing but the #E Way#!; turn from your families, your children, your gods, your loved ones. Seek nothing but the Way; abandon your ancestors and your oaths, set aside your traditions, let the graves of your forefathers be covered by darkness until they are forgotten. Nothing matters but the Way; it is the Way above everything else that must be Sought.'"
01_seekers_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the Seekers have formed an Autocratic Monarchy, one dedicated to spreading the light and the Seeking the Way that dispels all darkness."

01_seekers_task_1_DESC: "One of the earliest passages in the #E Annals of the Grand Inquisitor#!, a history of the Seeker Faith and its founding mythos, describes the heroic wars waged between the earliest Seekers and the dwarven town dwellers of Celtica in an account known as #E The Northern Hebric Crusade#!.\n\nAccording to the Annals, once the #Y Way That Is True#! began to be taught in the valleys of #E Celtica#!, a few pious Kings surrendered their authority to the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName], who then led the people to attack the decadent #E Hebric#! dwarves that lived in the northern mountains."

01_seekers_task_2: "Establish The Inquisitors"
01_seekers_task_2_DESC: "If we have any hopes of maintaining our control over the lands that we conquer, then we must have a #E Secret Police#! that will secretly work to maintain peace throughout [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] while hunting down the enemies that threaten the Way."

01_seekers_task_3: "Consolidating The Councils"
01_seekers_task_3_DESC: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName] finds its power to be diluted, too decentralized, and that is because there are too many Grand Masters ruling independently - there should be only one, and it must be [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Now that the dwarven abomination has been driven out from among us, we must quell dissenting voices and unite the various Councils under the banner of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

01_seekers_task_4: "Faithfully Seeking The Way"
01_seekers_task_4_DESC: "We cannot refrain from spreading the message of the Way, but must forcibly convert those that are unwilling to join the Path of Truth and Light. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will not rest until our countrymen have embraced the Message."

01_seekers_task_5_DESC: "In order to celebrate the victories that our levies have won for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has declared a ten year period of jubilee - one for each of the provinces that our mighty Knights have taken for the faithful."

01_seekers_task_6: "The Warlock's Academy"
01_seekers_task_6_DESC: "While the unrestricted use of magic has been blamed for the #E Great Collapse#! and the world-shattering cataclysms that followed, the Seeker Council cannot afford to ignore this potential source of strength. Instead of letting the mages run amok, however, we shall train them in the proper use of the arcane at an #Y Warlock Academy#! we will build in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."

01_seekers_task_7: "Dwarven Slaves"
01_seekers_task_7_DESC: "The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName] has issued a command from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] regarding that status of the subjugated dwarves living within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]. There are rumors that soulgems @soulgems! have been found in [GetProvince('(int32)3406').GetName], and it is the wish of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] that the Common Dwarf returns to the mines that his people are so familiar with."

01_seekers_task_8: "Kalkomie Farmlands"
01_seekers_task_8_DESC: "The #E Common Dwarves#! that used to live in these provinces before the #E Northern Hebric Crusade#! destroyed their kingdoms were mostly farmers, simple workers tending to the rich black soil that kept their granaries filled. The time has come for our people to take advantage of the limited farmlands available to us and expand our infrastructure."

01_seekers_task_9: "Founders Of The Way"
01_seekers_task_9_DESC: "The region of #E Celtica#! was destined to be the birthplace of the #E Seeker Beliefs#!, and once the Way has been embraced by the majority of peoples living within our mountainous valley, we will proclaim ourselves to the world as the 'Founders of the Way' - the nation that brought true religion to Weagaelia."

01_seekers_task_10_DESC: "In the greatest triumph ever recorded by Seeker historians, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has conquered a worthy nation for the people within the heartlands of #E Celtica#!, taking the entire region for the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName].\n\nNow, the time has come to proclaim the arrival of the #Y Holy Order of the Seekers#! - we shall not rest until the light of the Way is shared with all of the apostate kingdoms of Omniluxia."

01_seekers_task_11: "Subduing Southern Celtica"
01_seekers_task_11_DESC: "Slowly, by degrees, the Seeker Faith has spread throughout the northern provinces of #E Celtica#!. As the Way guides our path forward, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName] has declared that we shall not rest until we have freed the south from the tyranny of religious oppression."

01_seekers_task_12: "The Call To Submit"
01_seekers_task_12_DESC: "Now that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has grown to a respectable size, it has been suggested that we send messages to the remaining [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName]s that do not recognize our authority and tell them the time has come to submit."

01_seekers_task_13: "The Three Doors"
01_seekers_task_13_DESC: "Now that we have secured possession of the region of #E Celtica#!, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetGovernment.GetName] has insisted that we built fortresses at the three entrances to our valley. We must not allow the enemies of the Way to have easy access to our core territories!"

01_seekers_task_14: "Marching To The Morrigans"
01_seekers_task_14_DESC: "As our grip continues to tighten on the northern territories within the region of #E Celtica#!, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], riding high from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] string of impressive victories, has announced that the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] must complete the unfinished tasks of the #E Northern Hebric Crusade#! by destroying the other dwarven kingdoms around us.\n\nFor the first time in our history, our levies will march for the #E Morrigan Mountains#! to the west and cast down the abominable dwarves that live there."

01_seekers_task_15_DESC: "As the glory and light of the Way spreads throughout the lands within our dominions, our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has received a gift from the craftsmen living within the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3502').GetName] - an exquisitely-crafted weapon that is known as the #Y Grand Maul of the Seeker Inquisitor#!."
