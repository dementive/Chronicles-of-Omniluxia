 jarenam_empire_heritage: "Jarenam Heritage"
 jarenam_empire_heritage_desc: "The vengeful King of Dragons, the Jarenam Empire was forged by the fires of the Dunydurceg-Geallian wars. The Gaelli peoples displaced the Sovenarians, resulting in an exodus of the dragonkin from their homeland. After the fall of the great Zani Empire, however, one vengeful soldier, known as Jaren the Formidable Dragon, landed in the port of Zemmairthia and ravaged it, killing all the Gaelli settlers. From that day forth, the newfound Jareni state conquered all it could see, even reaching the lands of the Baetep in their merciless onslaught. However, Jaren died with no successors. Now, the Jarenam Empire stands as a multiethnic empire that is as unstable as the final days of the Zani Empire. Will the Jarenam vengence be cut short, or will the Draconic Empire stand to obliterate the Zani successor kingdoms?"

 kaffira_kingdom_heritage: "Kaffira Heritage"
 kaffira_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Kaffira Kingdom exists on the outskirts of civilization. Conquered by a Draconic people, the invaders quickly assimilated and adopted the local ways to survive the harsh desert environment. This new Kaffarian culture quickly became the greatest state within the realms of Zainudd. It is said that, like the two prophets of Zainudd who bore the religion of Zainuddian, the two peoples of Kaffira who bore the Kaffarian culture will storm the lands and unite all the true believers into one unified state. Only then will the divine be able to expand its horizons and conquer all those who worship heresies."

 zarakens_kingdom_heritage: "Heritage of Kyaxares"
 zarakens_kingdom_heritage_desc: "Of the many city states of Zakaria, Kyaxares proved to be the greatest of all. Over time, the league of Kyaxeres formed and a golden age proceeded. But then the two prophets of Zainudd came and wreaked havoc upon the land with their message of an impending Apocalypse. Despite this turmoil, Kyaxeres would soon become the new home for one of the holy men, Bachin, Lord of Dui-Pattar, and the city-state quickly established a new governance system around him. Although much of the golden foothills now belongs to bickering tribes, the Kyaxerid-led Zarakens, brandishing their new faith, are poised to reconquer the rich lands and fulfill the prophecies; to unite all the Zainudds together and then destroy the nonbelievers."

 soventeir_empire_heritage: "Soventeir Imperial Heritage"
 soventeir_empire_heritage_desc: "The vast, seemingly endless plains of the south are the heartlands of the Soventeir Empire. When the Zani Empire rose and invaded long ago, the Geallian people living on the plains were already well-established and were able to resist. In the aftermath of the Great Collapse, the governor of Soveneria agreed to rule over the Weageli in exchange for protecting them from the resentful Sovenerians, who desired their rich cities for themselves. With this powersharing agreement in place, the Empire quickly grew, and with the experience and help of Weagelians, the Soventeir were able to expand their borders, quickly surpassing all others and vastly extending their holdings. Although their Dragonkin brothers and cousins despise them, sometimes it is better to be one's friend than one's enemy."

 lindum_heritage: "Lindum Heritage"
 lindum_heritage_desc: "The greatest of Nazani colonies, Lindum was established by Helluvian refugees fleeing the Zanisite religious majority in the Nazani Empire. The natives were friendly enough with the peaceful Helluvian colonists, however when resources became scarce, war became plentiful. The superior Nazani technology allowed Lindum to conquer large swathes of Vetalia, giving them security for the future - as well as ambitions to conquer even more."

 malavanes_heritage: "Malavanes Heritage"
 malavanes_heritage_desc: "The westernmost Elves in all of Omniluxia, the Malavenes lead the Malvanie League due to their prime position on the continent. Their capital, Shall'shall'Ina, is a holy site for the Path of Life. The independent Malvanie colonies were once at risk of being overrun by natives, but their indomitable spirit allowed them to prevail. Although each of our far-flung colonies believed in a different philosophy, the Malavanes were able to convince the locals that their lives could be extended, should they listen to the Path of Life, and the natives could not resist. The Malavanes extended their lifespans but at the cost of being unable to reproduce. This enraged the natives, but, being no longer able to risk losing lives, they yielded to the Malavenes."

 myahudya_kingdom_heritage: "Myahudya Kingdom Heritage"
 myahudya_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Myahudan Kingdom was once a loose confederation of barbarous tribes, but it is said that the Zornakyan Dynasty of the Yeza tribe received a visitor from far away Luxterra bearing grim news - it was a Gorzaari priest that was fleeing from the recent conquests of the Zani Empire over his people. He explained his goddess, the goddess of victory, watched over him and let him arrive in this blessed land, where he would meet a King and share with him divine symbols of strength. The incredulous King of the Yeza tribe would laugh at this tale, yet the priest insisted that his words were true and then challenged anyone to defeat him in a contest of poetry. It would be impossible for him to win, as he hardly could speak the native tongue, yet whenever stepped forward to challenge the priest, his opponent would choke on seemingly nothing and die. The petty King of Yeza was taken aback at this supernatural display, and, deciding to test this goddess once more, commanded that the solar symbol of the victory goddess be displayed upon the swords and shields of his soldiers. To his amazement, he managed to obtain victory after victory against forces two, three times greater than his own. He declared the goddess to be the patroness of the newly founded kingdom."

 zewggad_republic_heritage: "Zewggad Republic"
 zewggad_republic_heritage_desc: "The Zewggad Republic sits at the mouth of the Intermarenican Sea on the island of Marenica. Because of this, it has poetically been said that all boats eventually lead to Marenica, which is home to some of the greatest markets in the entire world. The Zewggad Republican system operates on wealth; money rules everything. The richest citizens naturally rule over everything, and this system has lead to the islanders having a reputation for being corrupt penny-pinchers and greed-obssessed fools, yet all acknowledge that their parsimonious ways have only helped the Zewggad prosper."

 razani_heritage: "Razani Heritage"
 razani_heritage_desc: "The great Empire of the East, known to all as the Razani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of Unified Zani' or 'Empire of the United People.' The Razani Empire rose from the ashes of the Eastern half of the Zani Empire from the days of old. Unlike its counterpart to the west, the Razani Empire retains a 'purer' form of culture and often cites this as a tool of legitimacy against their rival-sibling to the west." 
 ####
 nazani_heritage: "Nazani Heritage"
 nazani_heritage_desc: "The great Empire of the West, known to all as the Nazani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of the Rebirthed Zani' or 'Empire of the People Reborn.' The Nazani Empire is a remnant of the Zani Empire from the days of old, but, unlike her counterpart in the east, the Razani, the Nazani people intermarried with the local peoples and created the new 'Weageli' culture."  

 gardowie_heritage: "Gardowie Heritage"
 gardowie_heritage_desc: "The Gardowie Clan were once the leaders of a large confederacy of Pomerian statelets. They managed to become the de facto leader of the others by capturing the fortress city of Wiaalda Garda in ancient times. The city has never been taken over since, and legends say that it took the powers of both Zerywan deities together to breach the walls. However, the ancient tribute-based system of the Gardowie Clan has fallen into disarray, and now it only holds its immediate neighbors within its sphere of influence. The fate of the fabled Unfallen City is perhaps soon to be called into question..."

 wielkolechowie_heritage: "Wielkolechowie Heritage"
 wielkolechowie_heritage_desc: "The mighty Wielkolechowie tribe rises from the ashes of the wartorn region of Lechia. Lechia was said, in myth, to be the birthplace of the Celestial Deer Jelenia. Because of the constant warfare, Jelenia left to Mount Malolech and graced the Zehian people instead.\n\nThe Wielkolechowie tribe derives its name from what others called them: the Noble Horsemen, Wielkolech. They stand in the prime position to unify the region of Lechia under one banner. And when the warring lords of Lechia unite, it is said that Jelenia will return and allow the uniters to conquer all they so wish to conquer."

 malolechowie_heritage: "Malozechowie Heritage"
 malolechowie_heritage_desc: "The people of the Celestial Deer reside in their great walled city of Starogod. It is said that in ancient times, the town was under siege by invaders from the west when the Celestial Deer Jelenia came down from the mountain and saved the city. Regardless of the truth to this myth, Mount Jelen is indeed the saving grace of the people, providing the rare resource of soulgems, making this once city state the most influential and civilized of the Zechii.\n\nThe name Malozechowie roughly translates to 'The Sons of Zehi at the Foot of the Mountain,' and may have been the original name of the grounds the city of Starogod is built upon."

 sertem_heritage: "Sertem Heritage"
 sertem_heritage_desc: "The House of Sertem is the first local dynasty of Baetep since its conquest by the great Zani Empire in the olden days. The Sertem, during the long years of Zanite slavery, rose to prominence by being administrators and governors over the Imperial province of Baetep. They were early converts to the Zanisite religion, granting them special privileges and placing them in an ideal position to capitalize on the chaos after the unexpected fall of the Zani Empire."

 kingdom_of_dune_heritage: "Heritage of Dune"
 kingdom_of_dune_heritage_desc: "The Kingdom of Dune and its ruling Djedhid dynasty has stood strong as one of the longest-lasting noble houses in all of Omniluxia. The kingdom is said to have been founded a thousand years before even the Gellaius Empire. A great deal of precious metals can be found within their lands, and with this immense wealth, monuments honoring the esteemed rulers of their household have been built throughout the land. For hundreds of years, no one has dared to attack the kingdom as tales of their savagery in war are known throughout the land. However, the aggressive Sertep dynasty is building an army, seizing power, and multiple border skirmishes between the two rival kingdoms have recently taken place. Will the Kingdom of Dune succumb to the boundless aggression of the upstart dynasts in Baetep, or will they continue to rule over the prosperous lands of Upper Baetep for thousands of more years to come?"

 azar_dwarves_heritage: "Azar Heritage"
 azar_dwarves_heritage_desc: "Like many of their other Golden Dwarf brothers, the Azar dwarves primarily reside in a single large centralized hold that hugs the great mountains of Luxterra. Their territory of Rinekkud has produced many of the most precious gold items in the world, and even during the days of the Zani Empire, the Emperors would make the long trek from the north to down to Rinekkud to see the excellence of the Azar dwarves first hand. Now, Rinekkud is threatened in a way that it has not been for hundreds of years, with the rapidly-expanding Kaffira Kingdom pressing on their borders. Although there have been no direct conflicts between the two factions, tensions have been boiling for years and truly anything could happen..."

 nofur_dwarves_heritage: "Nofur Heritage"
 nofur_dwarves_heritage_desc: "The dwarves, known as Nofur for their distinct lack of hair, are new on the scene, having migrated from the central Luxterra mountains only a few decades ago into lands that many thought were entirely uninhabitable. It did not take them long to turn their new home into a dwarven paradise, known far and wide as one of the most desirable places for common dwarves to reside. In the last few years, the Nofur leader has become increasingly belligerent, for the increase in population, due to migration, has led to social unrest in the kingdom. As a result, the dwarves now have begun to look outward once again to expand their territory to accommodate their ever-growing population."

 duny_heritage: "Duny Heritage"
 duny_heritage_desc: "Long ago, the people of Duny, together with the rest of the Selaskusian people, united together in one of the largest rebellions in history against the great Zani Empire. Under the glorious Banner of the Duny, the opressed steppe peoples were able to obtain momentary freedom from the Zani Emperors, but it was not long until the full wrath of the Zani would come down upon them, utterly destroying the alliance and returning them to slavery. This disaster occurred hundreds of years ago but now, after the Great Collapse, much of the Duny that were displaced and violently persecuted have recently declared their independence from the ailing Razani Empire. Will the Duny unite the Selaskusians to form a united front against the Zani dominance, or will they be crushed once again?"

 aralan_group: "Aralans Heritage"
 aralan_group_desc: "While most Aralan people have sworn oaths of fealty to the Aralan Kings, there are some that are unwilling to throw in their lot with the majority of their kinsmen, preferring to be left out of the vicious struggles against the Rohenoan and Celticans that press against their borders - these are the Aralans, who are loyal to themselves first and foremost." 
  
 zani_heritage: "Zani Heritage"
 zani_heritage_desc: "The Zani are the proud conquerors that threatened to subdue the entire world, brought down at the height of their power by the fatal mistakes made their Emperor. Although they had once splintered into two large groups, the Nazani and the Razani, there are still those that do not define themselves by notions of 'Western' or 'Eastern', but self-identify as pure Zani. It goes without saying that the unspoken dream of most Zani is the rebirth of their glorious Empire."

 geallian_group: "Geallian Heritage"
 geallian_group_desc: "The Geallians appear in the histories and records of many of the surrounding nations, for these people have had an outsized influence on those around them. Known for their adventurous spirits and love of glory, Geallian heroes have long left the shores of their homeland to seek their destinies all throughout Omniluxia, with some being wildly successful and others fading unremembered into the endless night. Good warriors and even better traders, the only thing negative that can be said about the Geallians is that they are an unpious people - they are no lovers of the gods, but care mostly for themselves."

 beatepian_group: "Baetepian Heritage"
 beatepian_group_desc: "Within the lands of the Baetep, the House of Sertem has become the main powerbroker within the region, but this is not to say that there are not smaller groups that are powerful - the Baetepians are proof that Sertem supremacy is not a done deal. Whether or not the Baetepians will be able to preserve their unique culture remains to be seen, but they are clinging tenaciously to their ideals and have yet to be conquered."

 beatepian_upper_group: "Upper Baetepian Heritage"
 beatepian_upper_group_desc: "While the inexorable power of the House of Sertem is growing within Baetep, there are still cultural enclaves that have resisted the pressures to assimilate, and the Upper Baetapians are chief among those that refuse to bow their heads in submission. Luckily for them, they have many sons that are willing to fight to preserve their way of life; their manpower resources are said to dwarf those of their neighbors."

 eastern_zerywani_group: "Eastern Zerywani Heritage"
 eastern_zerywani_group_desc: "Thousands of years ago, the Zerywani Horde split into two large groups, and the Eastern Zerywani are the descendants that settled in the lowlands and plains of southeast Luxterra. They are quite proud of their civilization and are more than happy to separate themselves from their Western kinsmen, who never abandoned the nomadic ways of their forefathers."

 western_zerywani_group: "Western Zerywani Heritage"
 western_zerywani_group_desc: "Thousands of years ago, the Zerywani Horde split into two large groups, and the Western Zerywani are the descendants of the nomads that went far beyond Mount Jelen, heading for the coasts of the Navshodia Sea, although some of their kinsmen remained near Mount Pomair. The Western Zerywani have maintained their ancient traditions, refusing to build permanent settlements but embracing a migratory lifestyle instead. In the last few decades, they have been moving into the marshes of southern Luxterra, causing tension with the Steppe Peoples who have settled there."

 intermarenican_group: "Intermarenican Heritage"
 intermarenican_group_desc: "The fecund farmlands and rolling plains that are surrounded by the Marenica Sea are the traditional homelands of the Intermarenicans, who have long thrived on the shores of that calm ocean. While not strong politically - there are dozens of Intermarenican petty kingdoms - they have been forced time and time again to repel the dreadful Razani, who have long sought to conquer the territories to their east."

 werhenlander_group: "Werhenlander Heritage"
 werhenlander_group_desc: "Werhenlanders are a noble people, with a culture that is guided by chivalric principles and lead by Knights, who are the top of Werhenlanded society. Said to be a dour and humorless people, it comes as a surprise to many to find that the taciturn Werhenlanders are faithful adherents of the Helluvian Faith, and in ages past, many Werhenlander Knights lead crusading armies against the heretics surrounding them."

 werhenssian_group: "Werhenssian Heritage"
 werhenssian_group_desc: "Werhenssian society is a beautiful enigma to outsiders, with many foreigners being captivated by their unique style and cultural traditions; indeed, the image of a bearded Werhenssian cavalryman, dressed in traditional flowing robes while riding his mount on the plains, is a romantic one that features in many Razani folktales. The Werhenssian are known for their fairness, with the stranger having the same rights within their society as blood kinsmen."

 rohenoan_group: "Rohenoan Heritage"
 rohenoan_group_desc: "The story of the Rohenoan people is one that is filled with countless wars, savage massacres and periods of enslavement, and over the years, this bloody history has created a culture that places a high value on military strength of arms. A well-equipped Rohenoan Knight, resplendent in head to toe in expensive gem-encrusted armor, is said to be one of the deadliest foes one could ever meet on the battlefield, for they are unrelenting in their assaults and fight with the ferocity of a people that bow their heads for no one. Bitter and laconic in temperament, the Rohenoan are known for their gallow's humor and their willingness to fight for honor."

 zani_vetalian_group: "Zani-Vetalian Heritage"
 zani_vetalian_group_desc: "Some Vetalians did not hide from the opportunities that the gods brought to their ancestors, choosing to show hospitality to the Zani colonists and ultimately changing the history of their nation forever. Over time, the sons and daughters of the two nations became as one, and these Zani-Vetalians soon drove their xenophobic cousins deep into the mountains, shattering their defensive leagues and taking the choicest lands for themselves."

 seeker_group: "Seeker Heritage"
 seeker_group_desc: "Rohenoan, Celtican, Vetalian, Zani - the Seekers have blood connections to all of these people, but they are not guided by any notion of kinship; the only thing that matters is what they Seek. Viewed as obsessive fundamentalists by many and described as joyless and intense, the Seekers have renounced their previous identities in order to fully embrace their religious ideals - a peculiarity that is viewed with suspicion by their neighboring communities."

 norrfallian_group: "Norrfallian Heritage"
 norrfallian_group_desc: "Norrfallians are the natives of the northeastern peninsula of Luxterra, having long ago established the monarchies and kingdoms that are the seat of their power. Although they have a storied history that is filled with heroic tales of conquest and splendor, as of late, their recent past has been defined by their struggles against the breakaway Northlanders, who have humbled their civilized cousins on the battlefield more times than the Norrfallians would like to remember."

 errnorfallian_group: "Errnorfallian Heritage"
 errnorfallian_group_desc: "The Errnorfallians are distant kinsmen to both the Norrfallians and the Northlanders, and over the years, they have fought against both of these nations. While they remain some cultural similarities, their religious practices are quite different; their beliefs are diverse, with many smaller religious communities thriving within their traditional homelands. The Errnorfallians are wary of the High Elven colonies on their coasts, and it is believed that war between their people is an inevitability."

 dragkhanic_group: "Drakhanic Heritage"
 dragkhanic_group_desc: "'To be born Drakhanic is to live with one foot in the grave', as the old saying goes, yet even this aphorism does not do justice to the cruelty and violence that is the hallmark of Drakhanic society. Visitors to their lands often arrive heavily armed and with a retinue of guards, for the lone traveler is a target for slavers and brigands - there are many merchants and diplomats who have thought they would be safe from the pillaging rovers, yet they are spending their last days chained in a salt mine."

 orcish_a_group: "Rendun Orcs Heritage"
 orcish_a_group_desc: "There are many orcs who have left their island of Remun over the centuries; many formed mercenary companies, joining their numbers with levies gathering in strange lands, and others followed in the footsteps of these brave Orcish sellswords. Over time, tens of thousands of Orcs had banded together, forming communities and settlements, and by the time of the Great Collapse, they had formed kingdoms and countries of their own."

 orcish_b_group: "Remun Orcs Heritage"
 orcish_b_group_desc: "The Isle of Remun at the heart of the Central Omniluxian Sea is the original homeland of all Orcish people, with those who live on the island maintaining a distinctive culture from the many others orcs that live scattered across the world. The three main Clans on Remun - the Ioleic, the Longonesi and the Parati - have long struggled for supremacy against each other, with their many wars of aggression sending many displaced Orcish refugees and slaves to foreign shores."

 common_dwarves_group: "Common Dwarves Heritage"
 common_dwarves_group_desc: "'Common' Dwarves have never lived underground like many of their cousins, choosing instead to build farms and cities on the surface and thus interacting with the human kingdoms around them. They are skillful builders and tough hill fighters, but for all of their physical hardness, they are said to enjoy the finer things in life, like silks and wine - claims that are usually made under the breath, lest they be heard by the hotheaded Common Dwarves."

 golden_dwarves_group: "Golden Dwarves Heritage"
 golden_dwarves_group_desc: "Golden Dwarves are the finest craftsmen of jewelry in all Omniluxia and unparalleled smiths, with merchants coming from as far away as Shall'shall'Ina to procure the gem-encrusted statues that are produced in the Dwarven workshops. Because of their skill working with precious metals, they have an unfair reputation for being greedy and they are resented by many of their neighbors, who accuse the Dwarves of hoarding their wealth and using it to fund wicked experiments within their cities."

 silver_dwarves_group: "Silver Dwarves Heritage"
 silver_dwarves_group_desc: "Ancestors of mountain-dwelling dwarves that lived far below the surface of Omniluxia, the Silver Dwarf is known to turn heads when appearing on the surface, for many men have never seen the bluish tint to their skin that gives them their name. Naturally healthy and of robust constitutions, they are clumsy fighters and not as sophisticated as their hill-dwelling cousins the Common Dwarves."

 arteonian_group: "Arteonian Heritage"
 arteonian_group_desc: "The Arteonians are an ancient race, sharing many characteristics with both humans and elves - their blood is said to be full of magic. According to their legends, when the world was young and the gods struggled to contain the threat of the Dragons, there was a giant wyrm, a beast named Arteon, who was slain by the legendary hero Artheousan. As the dragon lay dying, its breath and blood coalesced into the form of a beautiful woman; a bride for the mighty Artheousan, and the mother of the first Arteonians."

 north_arteonian_group: "North Arteonian Heritage"
 north_arteonian_group_desc: "Centuries ago, there was a minor religious schism that divided the Arteonians into two groups, and although the Elders tried their best to mend the division within their society, when reconciliation was deemed impossible, it was decided that the splinter group should be expelled. The North Arteonians, as they have come to be known, still share many characteristics with their Arteonian cousins, yet they have developed their own traditions, dialects and sacred rituals."

 high_elves_group: "High Elves Heritage"
 high_elves_group_desc: "Haughty, cruel, arrogant, waspish - this short list of attributes describing the High Elves is definitely not a pleasant one, yet even the Elves would agree with how they are portrayed here. Notoriously suspicious of outsiders, High Elves nevertheless spend a great deal of time interacting with foreigners, particularly because they seem to be attempting to carve out an Empire for themselves. They are viewed with suspicion and fear by other Elves, and other races only bargain with them when they absolutely have to."

 forest_elves_group_1: "Deep Wood Elf Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_1_desc: "The Deep Wood Elves claim to be the oldest and wisest of their kind - a claim that is vehemently denied by the High Elves. Few have seen their homelands, the pristine forests of eastern Luxterra that are nestled high within the mountains, for the Deep Elves are highly suspicious of outsiders, especially the warmongering Werhenlanders. They maintain semi-friendly relations with the Common Dwarves, but as a rule, they do not trust most humans."

 forest_elves_group_2: "Forest Elf Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_2_desc: "While Forest Elves are respectful of the virgin woodlands that comprises their homeland, they have not let their religious affinities dictate their entire way of life; something that separates them from their cousins the Deep Wood Elves and the more extreme Followers of the Forest. Forest Elves can be found within many of the cities throughout Omniluxia, and if one personally knows an Elf, it is likely that they claim the Forest Heritage."

 forest_elves_group_3: "Followers of the Forest"
 forest_elves_group_3_desc: "Those who have allowed their past identities to be subsumed by Mother Nature are never saddened by the loss of their previous lives, but instead find a beauty and a freedom in the Forest that is unmatched by anything that they have ever experienced before. Followers of the Forest can only begrudgingly be found within cities and walls, choosing instead to feel the soft grass of a shaded grove beneath their bared feet instead."

 northlanders_group: "Northlanders Heritage"
 northlanders_group_desc: "A breakaway cultural group from the Norrfallians, the Northlanders rejected the soft, civilizing influences that were pervasive within the corrupt Norrfallian society and chose to pursue a simpler way of life instead. When the angry Norrfallians attacked their barbarous cousins, hoping to bring them back within their fold as slaves, they were defeated in battle by the Northlander berserkers, who hold a special place in Northlander society to this day. The mere thought of the Berserker, dressed from head to toe in furs, their face streaked with woad and a prayer of destruction on their lips, has been known to strike terror in the hearts of Norrfallians."

 borderlander_group: "Borderlander Heritage"
 borderlander_group_desc: "Borderlanders have long fought to keep their identities separate from the twin juggernauts of the Soventeir and Nazani Empires that surround them, and although they are just as likely to fight amongst themselves as they are to join together to repel invaders, they are faithful friends and unforgiving enemies."

 celtican_group: "Celtican Heritage"
 celtican_group_desc: "While many tribes continue to wander the face of Omniluxia, following the stars as they search for good grazing land, some people, like the Celticans, have abandoned their formerly savage ways for good, with many choosing to permanently settle in the expansive forests that have been their home for centuries. They still retain many of the habits of their nomadic forebears, however; many live in isolated, scattered communities, which has historically contributed to the dearth of manpower that has plagued their armies."

 vetalian_group: "Vetalian Heritage"
 vetalian_group_desc: "The Vetalians are the descendents of those that resisted the overtures of the Zani colonists, turning away from the stranger's gifts of gold and gems and remaining separate as a people. While some of their kinsmen gave their daughters to the sons of the foreigners, the Vetalians kept to the Old Ways, albeit for naught - they soon suffered many ignoble defeats, overwhelmed by the Nazani technology that decimated their ranks and drove them from their ancestral homes."

 zinduidian_group: "Zinduidian Heritage"
 zinduidian_group_desc: "The tribes of the Zinduidian people have long ignored the goings-on around them, preferring instead to focus on their internal affairs and allowing their squabbling neighbors to continue their petty wars against each other. If disaster threatens their people, however, then they are quick to ride to each other's aid, for they are unwilling to allow others to hold sway over them. While they are said to have originated from the deserts, their domains now include fertile farmlands and wide, expansive plains. Over the years, the Jarenam Empire has hired many Zinduidian mercenaries on their behalf, for none know the southern coasts like they do."
 
 kinones_group: "Kinones Heritage"
 kinones_group_desc: "The jovial Kinones are distant relatives of the human race that appear to be far less aggressive than their human counterparts. They are a bit shorter, but tougher than the average human, and Kinones are, as a rule, generally taller than dwarves. Kinones live simple lives in their peaceful valleys and work to create prosperous places for their kinsmen to live - they are far more focused on their economy and agriculture than their neighbors."

 etaredican_group: "Etaredican Heritage"
 etaredican_group_desc: "The Etaredicans were the original inhabitants of the forested wildlands that comprised the hinterlands of the Jarenam Empire, but as Jaren the Formidable Dragon conquered the coastal tribes, the Etaredicans were pushed out of their homelands by waves of migrating Esquelians. While they lamented the loss of their way of life, their former existence in the mountains had created a hearty race, which was quickly able to subdue the undefended plains that now form the heartland of the Etaredican people."

 zarakens_group: "Zarakens Heritage"
 zarakens_group_desc: "The identity of the Zarakens was forged during a time of crisis for their people; religious conflicts were brought by the Prophets of the Zainuddians and the Zarakens were one of the first groups to convert en masse, hoping to find a source of strength with the strange new heresy. Said to be lovers of money first and foremost - undoubtedly a slur against their willingness to fight for their faith - the Zarakens are Horselords, unbridled masters of heavy cavalry."

 phanician_group: "Phanician Heritage"
 phanician_group_desc: "Once a great trading nation that dominated the waves, the Phanicians have slowly seen their influence wane over the centuries; their expansive holdings were destroyed and conquered by the Jarenam Empire, and the remaining Phanicians were forced to flee to the north, where they currently rule over a rump state that is a pale imitation of what it was once. While the Phanicians are ashamed of their current state, what is even worse for them is that they have forgotten their former ways; once hailed as the best sailors in all Omniluxia, their naval prowess have withered and atrophied."

 esquelian_group: "Esquelian Heritage"
 esquelian_group_desc: "The Esquelians once lived alongside the shores of the Intergealian Sea, and yet they were pushed from their gentle beaches and quiet cities by the invading forces of the Jarenam. As a people, they are not strong warriors, yet their diplomats are some of the most skillful orators within all Omniluxia, and it is by their eloquence that they have managed to survive as a nation. The Jarenam Empire has tolerated the presence of the Esquelians in the mountains and forests as long as trade and tribute continues to flow westerward, believing that the tribes pose no threat to their continued expansion."

 hazalars_group: "Hazalars Heritage"
 hazalars_group_desc: "The Hazalars are a savage group of nomads that have doubled down on their primitive way of life, killing all that have sought to bring civilization to their wild badlands. They are, without a doubt, the best riders in Luxterra, and their bands of horse archers have been known to destroy armies three or four times their size. Not even the Zani Empire, in their heyday, were able to tame the Hazalars, which remains a point of pride to this very day."

 polarian_nations_heritage: "Polarian Heritage"
 polarian_nations_heritage_desc: "The Polarians are a hearty race of humans that live in some of the most inhospitable regions of Omniluxia, and the bitter cold and bone-chilling winds of their frozen isle never seems to bother them. The Polarians are master hunters and trackers, able to eke out survival in the harshest of terrains, and they excel at fighting in the snow-covered plains of their homeland. Their storied kingdoms are of great antiquity, and yet few are the travelers who visit their frost-cloaked cities at the roof of the world."

 snakefolk_group: "Ular-Pria Heritage"
 snakefolk_group_desc: "The inhabitants of the southern Austropetolian islands, known to many as the snakefolk but to themselves as the Ular-Pria, have been extremely isolated from civilization for thousands of years. No one knows how they became the way they are, but some historians suggest the snakefolk once inhabited all of Omniluxia long before the inception of the human race. Abandoned snake temples, the ominous remains of a time long past, can be found all over Omniluxia. No one has dared to disturb the snakefolk on their islands for centuries, as they are known to kill all who enter their lands with no remorse - not even the Zani Empire dared to impose themselves upon the snakefolk tribes. The only humans the snakefolk traditionally interact with are their fellow Austropetolians, who mostly reside on the north of the archipelago, and over many centuries of coexisting, there has developed a hybrid human-snakefolk society. For much of history, the snakefolk tribes have been heavily decentralized, but recently a great number of snakefolk have united under the name of the Euryalean League and are starting to send diplomatic missions to outsiders. To many, this is a cause for great concern, for the true intentions and nature of the snakefolk have always been shrouded in mystery..."

 austropetolian_group: "Austropetolian Heritage"
 austropetolian_group_desc: "Unwelcome in the human world and barely tolerated by serpentkind, the Austropetolians are a mixture of humankind and snakefolk, the descendants of escaped slaves that found their freedom living on the abandoned islands south of Eptelon. Austropetolians are natural sailors, taking to the water with an unnatural ease that makes humans feel jealous, and their skill with boats has led many of their numbers to pursue a life of piracy on the Arteptolian Sea."

 eptelon_group: "Eptelonian Heritage"
 eptelon_group_desc: "The Eptelonian tribes live on the island that gives them their name, and for as long as anyone can remember, they have been fighting against the invading Horteonions for control of Eptelonia's jungles and mountains. Having long ago abandoned their migratory ways, the Eptelonians have built permanent settlements and homesteads for their people, but constant raiding from the Horteonians has made life difficult, and the appearance of High Elven colonists in the north has only complicated matters for the volatile region."

 horteonian_group: "Horteonian Heritage"
 horteonian_group_desc: "The Horteonians are a hearty race of humans that hail from the northern island of Horteon at the edge of the world; a cruel land, one that is bitter and cold like the tribes that were borne out of her frozen mountain wastelands. Hundreds of years ago, the Horteonians sailed from their harsh island and invaded Arteon and Eptelon, and although they were mighty conquerors that carved out many kingdoms, within a few generations, they abandoned their traditional Hortenic faith for the worship of the Wyrm-Slayer. Artheousan missionaries managed to successfully convert the Horteonians, and they have eagerly embraced the religion, spreading it through the lands they seized by fire and the sword."

 alaguric_group: "Alaguric Heritage"
 alaguric_group_desc: "The Alaguric tribes survive off of violence and rapine, selling their exceptional talents for plundering to local warlords and desperate Kings. When they are not enslaving their countless victims, a cruel skill in which they delight, they are racing their horses across the plains."
 
 flusenlander_heritage: "Flusenlander Heritage"
 flusenlander_heritage_desc: "The migratory tribes of the Flusenlanders live on the eastern coasts of Luxterra and are the most isolated people in all of Omniluxia. Some of the Flusenlanders live close to the Errnorfallians, but most have wandered deep into the forests and plains to places where they have no neighbors. Although they clearly crave solitude, they have also been known to migrate far from their homes without any warning, appearing thousands of miles away from where they last built their temporary settlements - their desire to be left alone could change at any time."

 selaskusian_heritage_desc: "A foreigner might not be able to distinguish a Selaskusian from any of the other nomadic tribes that wander the Skyreach Steppes, but this would be a fatal mistake to repeat, for it is said that the Selaskusian are more violent than their Duny or Alaguric cousins - a sobering thought, indeed. Selaskusian nomad hordes have been known to descend upon entire cities, enslaving tens of thousands at once, and it is for this reputation as civilization destroyers that they are feared by all."
 
 aralans_heritage: "Aralans Heritage"
 aralans_heritage_desc: "The Aralan people emerge from unknown origins, having conquered much of the peninsula at some point forgotten to history. However, their successions have become infamous for their carnage and savagery, and whenever one of their leaders dies, the land is wracked with civil wars that are brutal in character. While they once controlled all of their homelands, their power has fractured over time,no doubt due to their horrendous infighting, although it shows some signs of coalescing once more. The Aralans Kingdom remains strongest in the south, defending against the native Rohenoan tribes and the invading Weageli forces in Bretagne."

 hobgoblin_heritage: "Hobgoblin Heritage"
 hobgoblin_heritage_desc: "Said to be the twisted children of dwarves and elves, or perhaps the cursed offspring of some dark and malevolent deity forgotten by man, Hobgoblins are a race of goblin-like creatures that are feared and despised by many, but misunderstood by all. Admittedly brutish in behavior and sometimes coming across as unpleasant in manner to those that they do not respect, Hobgoblins have thick yellow skin, reptilian eyes and are as tall as the average person, but are slightly stronger than their human counterparts. Although they are rumored to inhabit caves and other distant mountain valleys, they can mostly be found in the inner Dragon Pass, where they have ruled for as long as anyone can remember. Hobgoblin society is organized around a complex web of tribal blood oaths and ritualized religious observances, and there is a certain unspoken hierarchy in the village that is respected and acknowledged by all members of their community. They are exceedingly hostile to outsiders, killing all that enter their lands without their explicit permission, and perhaps with good reason - in the years past, many isolated Hobgoblin communities have been the victims of pogroms by outsiders, who have burned their villages and slaughtered their people without mercy and without provocation. Grimly determined to survive in a world that doesn't seem to have any room for them, the Hobgoblin cultures struggle against the dying of their light and are obsessed with preserving their way of life."

 drow_heritage: "Drow Heritage"
 drow_heritage_desc:0 "The Drow, also known as 'Dark Elves', are among the many ancient races of Omniluxia. Stories as old as time tell tales of the origin of these strange elves, it is said that at one point they looked and behaved just like the high elves of Horteon. Records speak of a small contingency of high elves who departed from Horteon for more fruitful lands and after sailing for years they finally settled deep in the mountains of Northeast Luxterra. Although these new lands were cold and harsh the elves found that they had everything they needed. They lived in peace for many years to come until several great calamities befell them, first earthquakes destroyed their homes and then a great pestilence came which nearly killed all of the elves. With only a small group of elves remaining the surrounding Northlander tribes descended upon them at night, slaughtering all who were not fortunate enough to escape. It is said that 50 elves escaped that day, surrounded by enemies and with no where to go they decided to flee deep into the intricate cave systems of the surrounding mountains. In these caves there was no light, no people, and many thought there was no hope for the remaining elves. After several days of trekking through the cave system the elves found an underwater lake several thousand meters below ground, with this they found hope as it contained fresh water, a strangely tasty species of cave fish, and thousands of edible mushrooms. It was here that the small tribe of elves would live for thousands of years, trapped beneath the ground with no way out and for no one to get in but at peace at last. Overtime the lack of sunlight and some strange elements of the mushrooms that they consumed transformed the elves into something entirely different from their original High Elf descendants...their eyes became black and their skin began to develop an otherworldly purple hue and they began to worship the primordial forces of darkness. In the darkness they dwelled for an unimaginable amount of time where they lived peacefully until the Great Collapse destroyed much of their underground habitat but it also reopened the way out of the caves. Out of necessity the Drow ascended back to the surface and once again established themselves along the outskirts of the mountains of Luxterra, the local inhabitants immediately vacated the area as they were terrified of their strange appearance. The Drow never let any of the locals close to them ever again, savagely killing all who entered their lands. In recent years some of the surrounding tribes have begun to interact with the Drow once again and even have come to accept their religion as their own, spreading the reverence for the dark forces throughout Northeast Luxterra."

Zorg are unlike anything else on the planet; they have a strange, reddish hue to their skin and wide piercing eyes. Astonishingly, the DNA of every member of their species seems to be entirely identical, with no genetic variation whatsoever, leading some to speculate if they are even living beings..."
