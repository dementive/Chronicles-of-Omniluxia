 jarenam_empire_heritage_desc:0 "The vengeful King of Dragons, the Jarenam Empire was forged by the fires of the Dunydurceg-Geallian wars. The Gaelli peoples displaced the Sovenarians, resulting in an exodus of the dragonkin from their homeland. After the fall of the great Zani Empire, however, one vengeful soldier, known as Jaren the Formiddable Dragon, landed in the port of Zemmairthia and ravaged it, killing all the Gaelli settlers. From that day forth, the newly found Jareni state conquered all it could see, stopping never, reaching the lands of the Baetep. However, Jaren died with no successors. Now, the Jarenam Empire stands as a multiethnic empire that is as unstable as the final days of the Zani Empire. Will the Jarenam vengence be cut short, or will the draconic empire stand to obliterate the Zani successor kingdoms."

When the Great Zani Empire rose and invaded, the Gaelli people were already well established and only further pushed the syncretism of the Dragon people and the settlers coming form afar. Upon the collapse, the governor of the region was able to establish rule over the Weageli settlers, in exchange for protecting them from more resentful Sovenerians. As a result, the Empire quicly grew and with the experience and help of Weagelians, they were able to expand to boundaries beyond the Zani Empire even managed. Although their Dragonkin brothers and cousins despise them, sometimes it is better to be one's friend than one's enemy."

A Gorzaari priest was fleeing from the recent conquest of the Great Zani Empire over his people. He explained his goddess, the goddess of Victory, watched over him and let him arrive in this great land. The petty King of the Yeza tribe would laugh at this tale, yet the priest insisted. The priest challenged anyone to defeat him in a contest of poetry. It would be impossible for him to win as he hardly could speak the native tongue. However, during this competition, his opponent would choke on seemingly nothing and die. The petty King of Yeza was taken aback. He decided to test this goddess once more, and on the shields and swords of his men, the solar symbol of the victory goddess was displayed. To his amazement, he managed to obtain victory after victory. He declared the goddess the patroness of the newly founded Kingdom."
