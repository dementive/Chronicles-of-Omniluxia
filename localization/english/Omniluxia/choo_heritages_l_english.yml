 jarenam_empire_heritage: "Heritage of Jarenam"
 jarenam_empire_heritage_desc: "Defeated by the powerful Soventeir Empire, the Jazari tribes were sent off to Bhaxnmrechtem, sold as slave-soldiers meant to tame the rebelling Etaredicans and Esquelians for the overextended Razani Empire. With the passing decades, their influence grew as the decadent Razani nobility in the region increasingly relied on their services until most government and military responsibilities were handled by Jazari slaves. Their luxurious lives came to an end when a young educated slave now known to us as Jarenam the Formidable led a revolt in the capital of the province, Zemmairthia, slaughtering the nobility and recruiting many experienced soldiers and ministers to his cause. After carving out an empire from the declining Razani, Jarenam died without an heir, allowing many of his conquests to slip out of the empire's control. After a brief succession crisis, the House of Totrazi was chosen to tame this unstable multi-ethnic empire, or face a complete collapse."

 kaffira_kingdom_heritage: "Kaffira Heritage"
 kaffira_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Kaffira Kingdom exists on the outskirts of civilization. Conquered by a Draconic people, the invaders quickly assimilated and adopted the local ways to survive the harsh desert environment. This new Kaffarian culture quickly became the greatest state within the realms of Zainudd. It is said that, like the two prophets of Zainudd who bore the religion of Zainudian, the two peoples of Kaffira who bore the Kaffarian culture will storm the lands and unite all the true believers into one unified state. Only then will the divine be able to expand its horizons and conquer all those who worship heresies."

 zarakens_kingdom_heritage: "Heritage of Kyaxares"
 zarakens_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Zarakens of the Kyaxares are much older than the fallen Zakara Kephal, with the pre-Zainudian Zaraken Empire once rivaling even the Zani Empire at their height. However, after the fall of both their empires and the slaughter of their royal family, the Zaraken rump state that now exists is but a pale imitation of their former glory. Despised by all their neighbors and considered heretics for their association with Helluvians by many of the Zainudian faithful, the Zarakens of Kyaxares must ascend or face oblivion."

 soventeir_empire_heritage: "Soventeir Imperial Heritage"
 soventeir_empire_heritage_desc: "The Sovenerians were once one of the many Dragkhan tribes surrounding the Dragon Mountains. When the Zani Empire split and the Nazani Empire found themselves busy dealing with the Marshlanders, the Sovenerians saw their chance and conquered the Zanic colonists who lived in the fertile plains of Kainaxarthos. While initially only interested in taxing their subjects, the Sovenerians began to adopt Zanic culture under Uttarasmake the Great, who even adopted the Helluvian religion of his Kainaxari subjects. Declaring himself an Emperor in the Zanic style, the Sovenerians now seek to emulate the Zani and aren't as cruel or ruthless as their Dragkhanic brothers. However, recent court intrigue and their new lifestyle have left the Soventeir Empire weak and vulnerable to civil war, uprisings, or destruction by more ambitious neighbors."

 lindum_heritage: "Lindum Heritage"
 lindum_heritage_desc: "The greatest of Nazani colonies, Lindum was established by Helluvian refugees fleeing the Zanisite religious majority in the Nazani Empire. The natives were friendly enough with the peaceful Helluvian colonists, however when resources became scarce, war became plentiful. The superior Nazani technology allowed Lindum to conquer large swathes of Vetalia, giving them security for the future - as well as ambitions to conquer even more."

 malavanes_heritage: "Malavanes Heritage"
 malavanes_heritage_desc: "The westernmost Elves in all of Omniluxia, the Malavenes lead the Malvanie League due to their prime position on the continent. Their capital, Shall'shall'Ina, is a holy site for the Path of Life. The independent Malvanie colonies were once at risk of being overrun by natives, but their indomitable spirit allowed them to prevail. Although each of our far-flung colonies believed in a different philosophy, the Malavanes were able to convince the locals that their lives could be extended, should they listen to the Path of Life, and the natives could not resist. The Malavanes extended their lifespans but at the cost of being unable to reproduce. This enraged the natives, but, being no longer able to risk losing lives, they yielded to the Malavenes."

 myahudya_kingdom_heritage: "Myahudya Kingdom Heritage"
 myahudya_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Myahudan Kingdom was once a loose confederation of barbarous tribes, but it is said that the Zornakyan Dynasty of the Yeza tribe received a visitor from far away Luxterra bearing grim news - it was a Gorzaari priest that was fleeing from the recent conquests of the Zani Empire over his people.\n\nHe explained his goddess, the Goddess of Victory, watched over him and let him arrive in this blessed land, where he would meet a King and share with him divine symbols of strength. The incredulous King of the Yeza tribe would laugh at this tale, yet the priest insisted that his words were true and then challenged anyone to defeat him in a contest of poetry. It would be impossible for him to win, as he hardly could speak the native tongue, yet whenever stepped forward to challenge the priest, his opponent would choke on seemingly nothing and die.\n\nThe petty King of Yeza was taken aback at this supernatural display, and, deciding to test this goddess once more, commanded that the solar symbol of the Viktreic goddess be displayed upon the swords and shields of his soldiers. To his amazement, he managed to obtain victory after victory against forces two, three times greater than his own. He declared the goddess to be the patroness of the newly-founded kingdom."

 zewggad_republic_heritage: "Zewggad Republic"
 zewggad_republic_heritage_desc: "The Zewggad Republic sits at the mouth of the Intermarenican Sea on the island of Marenica. Because of this, it has poetically been said that all boats eventually lead to Marenica, which is home to some of the greatest markets in the entire world. The Zewggad Republican system operates on wealth; money rules everything. The richest citizens naturally rule over everything, and this system has lead to the islanders having a reputation for being corrupt penny-pinchers and greed-obssessed fools, yet all acknowledge that their parsimonious ways have only helped the Zewggad prosper."

 razani_heritage: "Razani Heritage"
 razani_heritage_desc: "The great Empire of the East, known to all as the Razani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of Unified Zani' or 'Empire of the United People.' The Razani Empire rose from the ashes of the Eastern half of the Zani Empire from the days of old. Unlike its counterpart to the west, the Razani Empire retains a 'purer' form of culture and often cites this as a tool of legitimacy against their rival-sibling to the west." 
 ####
 nazani_heritage: "Nazani Heritage"
 nazani_heritage_desc: "The great Empire of the West, known to all as the Nazani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of the Rebirthed Zani' or 'Empire of the People Reborn.' The Nazani Empire is a remnant of the Zani Empire from the days of old, but, unlike her counterpart in the east, the Razani, the Nazani people intermarried with the local peoples and created the new 'Weageli' culture."  

 ytali_heritage: "Heritage of Cyrogelos"
 ytali_heritage_desc: "Established by the legendary Cyrogelos The Loyal as a homeland for his people, the Ytali have served the Zani and it's heirs dutifully for hundreds of years. However, with Eagelian colonists arriving in former Ytali lands, the popularity of Helluvianism amongst the Ytali people, and the weakening of Razani power, it might be time for the Ytalians to reconsider their allegiances."

 gardowie_heritage: "Gardowie Heritage"
 gardowie_heritage_desc: "The Gardowie Clan were once the leaders of a large confederacy of Pomerian statelets. They managed to become the de facto leader of the others by capturing the fortress city of Wiaalda Garda in ancient times. The city has never been taken over since, and legends say that it took the powers of both Zerywan deities together to breach the walls. However, the ancient tribute-based system of the Gardowie Clan has fallen into disarray, and now it only holds its immediate neighbors within its sphere of influence. The fate of the fabled Unfallen City is perhaps soon to be called into question..."

 wielkolechowie_heritage: "Wielkolechowie Heritage"
 wielkolechowie_heritage_desc: "The mighty Wielkolechowie tribe rises from the ashes of the wartorn region of Lechia. Lechia was said, in myth, to be the birthplace of the Celestial Deer Jelenia. Because of the constant warfare, Jelenia left to Mount Malolech and graced the Zehian people instead.\n\nThe Wielkolechowie tribe derives its name from what others called them: the Noble Horsemen, Wielkolech. They stand in the prime position to unify the region of Lechia under one banner. And when the warring lords of Lechia unite, it is said that Jelenia will return and allow the uniters to conquer all they so wish to conquer."

 malolechowie_heritage: "Malozechowie Heritage"
 malolechowie_heritage_desc: "The people of the Celestial Deer reside in their great walled city of Starogod. It is said that in ancient times, the town was under siege by invaders from the west when the Celestial Deer Jelenia came down from the mountain and saved the city. Regardless of the truth to this myth, Mount Jelen is indeed the saving grace of the people, providing the rare resource of soulgems, making this once city state the most influential and civilized of the Zechii.\n\nThe name Malozechowie roughly translates to 'The Sons of Zehi at the Foot of the Mountain,' and may have been the original name of the grounds the city of Starogod is built upon."

 sertem_heritage: "Sertem Heritage"
 sertem_heritage_desc: "Taking advantage of the weakened Razani and the death of Jarenam the Formidable, the House of Sertem has become the first independent dynasty of Baetep since its conquest by the Zani Empire centuries ago. The Sertem, during Zani rule, rose to prominence by being administrators and governors over the Imperial province of Baetep. Early converts to the Zanisite faith, they were granted special privileges that placed them in an ideal position to claim control of Baetep from the crumbling empires around them. With the reins of such a wealthy realm firmly in their control, the Sertem could easily turn their kingdom into one of the great powers of Omniluxia."

 kingdom_of_dune_heritage: "Heritage of Dune"
 kingdom_of_dune_heritage_desc: "The Kingdom of Dune and its ruling Djedhid dynasty has stood strong as one of the longest-lasting noble houses in all of Omniluxia and are the true descendants of the Pharons of old. Their ancient realm of Baetep is said to have been founded a thousand years before even the Geallian Empire, but the armies of Zanis the Great destroyed their armies and sacked their capital, ending their rule. Forced to abandon the Imperial Palaces by the Tariku Pyramids, the Djedhid nobility fled southward to Usire Baetep, where they rule as Kings and Queens over a small remnant of their shattered Empire."

 azar_dwarves_heritage: "Azar Heritage"
 azar_dwarves_heritage_desc: "Like many of their other Golden Dwarf brothers, the Azar dwarves primarily reside in a single large centralized hold that hugs the great mountains of Luxterra. The mines and workshops in the Sacred Gold Caves of Tiuban have produced many of the most precious gold items in the world, and even during the days of the Zani Empire, the Emperors would make the long trek from the north to down to Tiuban to see the excellence of the Azar dwarves first hand. Now, this ancient capital is threatened in a way that it has not been for hundreds of years, with the rapidly-expanding Kaffira Kingdom pressing on their borders. Although there have been no direct conflicts between the two factions, tensions have been boiling for years and truly anything could happen..."

 nofur_dwarves_heritage: "Nofur Heritage"
 nofur_dwarves_heritage_desc: "The dwarves, known as Nofur for their distinct lack of hair, are new on the scene, having migrated from the central Luxterra mountains only a few decades ago into lands that many thought were entirely uninhabitable. It did not take them long to turn their new home into a dwarven paradise, known far and wide as one of the most desirable places for common dwarves to reside. In the last few years, the Nofur leader has become increasingly belligerent, for the increase in population, due to migration, has led to social unrest in the kingdom. As a result, the dwarves now have begun to look outward once again to expand their territory to accommodate their ever-growing population."

 duny_heritage: "Duny Heritage"
 duny_heritage_desc: "Long ago, the people of Duny, together with the rest of the Selaskusian people, united together in one of the largest rebellions in history against the great Zani Empire. Under the glorious Banner of the Duny, the oppressed steppe peoples were able to obtain momentary freedom from the Zani Emperors, but it was not long until the full wrath of the Zani would come down upon them, utterly destroying the alliance and returning them to slavery. This disaster occurred hundreds of years ago but now, after the Great Collapse, much of the Duny that were displaced and violently persecuted have recently declared their independence from the ailing Razani Empire. Will the Duny unite the Selaskusians to form a united front against the Zani dominance, or will they be crushed once again?"

 aralan_group: "Aralans Heritage"
 aralan_group_desc: "Steadfast and brave, the Aralans people were Wildlander mercenaries employed by the Zani to secure and stabilize the Imperial province of Rohenoa from the unruly Rohenoans. Promised land in exchange for their services, they settled down and created small communities across Rohevia and Rohenoa. When the Zani abandoned the province, the Aralans were forced to fend for themselves, and while many swore fealty to one of the few Aralans kings, there were those who decided not to stick with their kinsmen to avoid the wars that engulfed the peninsula. These are the Aralans, who are loyal to themselves first and foremost." 
  
 zani_heritage: "Zani Heritage"
 zani_heritage_desc: "The Zani are the proud conquerors that threatened to subdue the entire world, brought down at the height of their power by the fatal mistakes made their Emperor. Although they had once splintered into two large groups, the Nazani and the Razani, there are still those that do not define themselves by notions of 'Western' or 'Eastern', but self-identify as pure Zani. It goes without saying that the unspoken dream of most Zani is the rebirth of their glorious Empire."

 geallian_group: "Geallian Heritage"
 geallian_group_desc: "The Geallians appear in the histories and records of many of the surrounding nations, for these people have had an outsized influence on those around them. Known for their adventurous spirits and love of glory, Geallian heroes have long left the shores of their homeland to seek their destinies all throughout Omniluxia, with some being wildly successful and others fading unremembered into the endless night. Good warriors and even better traders, the only thing negative that can be said about the Geallians is that they are an unpious people - they are no lovers of the gods, but care mostly for themselves."

 beatepian_group: "Baetepian Heritage"
 beatepian_group_desc: "Within the lands of the Baetep, the House of Sertem has become the main powerbroker within the region, but this is not to say that there are not smaller groups that are powerful - the Baetepians are proof that Sertem supremacy is not a done deal. Whether or not the Baetepians will be able to preserve their unique culture remains to be seen, but they are clinging tenaciously to their ideals and have yet to be conquered."

 beatepian_upper_group: "Upper Baetepian Heritage"
 beatepian_upper_group_desc: "While the inexorable power of the House of Sertem is growing within Baetep, there are still cultural enclaves that have resisted the pressures to assimilate, and the Upper Baetapians are chief among those that refuse to bow their heads in submission. Luckily for them, they have many sons that are willing to fight to preserve their way of life; their manpower resources are said to dwarf those of their neighbors."

 eastern_zerywani_group: "Eastern Zerywani Heritage"
 eastern_zerywani_group_desc: "Thousands of years ago, the Zerywani Horde split into two large groups, and the Eastern Zerywani are the descendants that settled in the lowlands and plains of southeast Luxterra. They are quite proud of their civilization and are more than happy to separate themselves from their Western kinsmen, who never abandoned the nomadic ways of their forefathers."

 western_zerywani_group: "Western Zerywani Heritage"
 western_zerywani_group_desc: "Thousands of years ago, the Zerywani Horde split into two large groups, and the Western Zerywani are the descendants of the nomads that went far beyond Mount Jelen, heading for the coasts of the Navshodia Sea, although some of their kinsmen remained near Mount Pomair. The Western Zerywani have maintained their ancient traditions, refusing to build permanent settlements but embracing a migratory lifestyle instead. In the last few decades, they have been moving into the marshes of southern Luxterra, causing tension with the Steppe Peoples who have settled there."

 intermarenican_group: "Intermarenican Heritage"
 intermarenican_group_desc: "The fecund farmlands and rolling plains that are surrounded by the Marenica Sea are the traditional homelands of the Intermarenicans, who have long thrived on the shores of that calm ocean. While not strong politically - there are dozens of Intermarenican petty kingdoms - they have been forced time and time again to repel the dreadful Razani, who have long sought to conquer the territories to their east."

 werhenlander_group: "Werhenlander Heritage"
 werhenlander_group_desc: "Werhenlanders are a noble people, with a culture that is guided by chivalric principles and lead by Knights, who are the top of Werhenlanded society. Said to be a dour and humorless people, it comes as a surprise to many to find that the taciturn Werhenlanders are faithful adherents of the Helluvian Faith, and in ages past, many Werhenlander Knights lead crusading armies against the heretics surrounding them."

 werhenssian_group: "Werhenssian Heritage"
 werhenssian_group_desc: "Werhenssian society is a beautiful enigma to outsiders, with many foreigners being captivated by their unique style and cultural traditions; indeed, the image of a bearded Werhenssian cavalryman, dressed in traditional flowing robes while riding his mount on the plains, is a romantic one that features in many Razani folktales. The Werhenssian are known for their fairness, with the stranger having the same rights within their society as blood kinsmen."

 rohenoan_group: "Rohenoan Heritage"
 rohenoan_group_desc: "The story of the Rohenoan people is one that is filled with countless wars, savage massacres and periods of enslavement, and over the years, this bloody history has created a culture that places a high value on military strength of arms. A well-equipped Rohenoan Knight, resplendent in head to toe in expensive gem-encrusted armor, is said to be one of the deadliest foes one could ever meet on the battlefield, for they are unrelenting in their assaults and fight with the ferocity of a people that bow their heads for no one. Bitter and laconic in temperament, the Rohenoans are known for their dry humor and their strong sense of honor."

 zani_vetalian_group: "Zani-Vetalian Heritage"
 zani_vetalian_group_desc: "Some Vetalians did not hide from the opportunities that the gods brought to their ancestors, choosing to show hospitality to the Zani colonists and ultimately changing the history of their nation forever. Over time, the sons and daughters of the two nations became as one, and these Zani-Vetalians soon drove their xenophobic cousins deep into the mountains, shattering their defensive leagues and taking the choicest lands for themselves."

 seeker_group: "Seeker Heritage"
 seeker_group_desc: "Rohenoan, Celtican, Vetalian, Zani - the Seekers have blood connections to all of these people, but they are not guided by any notion of kinship; the only thing that matters is what they Seek. Viewed as obsessive fundamentalists by many and described as joyless and intense, the Seekers have renounced their previous identities in order to fully embrace their religious ideals - a peculiarity that is viewed with suspicion by their neighboring communities."

 norrfallian_group: "Norrfallian Heritage"
 norrfallian_group_desc: "Norrfallians are the natives of the northeastern peninsula of Luxterra, having long ago established the monarchies and kingdoms that are the seat of their power. Although they have a storied history that is filled with heroic tales of conquest and splendor, as of late, their recent past has been defined by their struggles against the breakaway Northlanders, who have humbled their civilized cousins on the battlefield more times than the Norrfallians would like to remember."

 errnorfallian_group: "Errnorfallian Heritage"
 errnorfallian_group_desc: "The Errnorfallians are distant kinsmen to both the Norrfallians and the Northlanders, and over the years, they have fought against both of these nations. While they remain some cultural similarities, their religious practices are quite different; their beliefs are diverse, with many smaller religious communities thriving within their traditional homelands. The Errnorfallians are wary of the High Elven colonies on their coasts, and it is believed that war between their people is an inevitability."

 dragkhanic_group: "Dragkhanic Heritage"
 dragkhanic_group_desc: "'To be born Dragkhanic is to live with one foot in the grave', as the old saying goes. Yet even this aphorism does not do justice to the cruelty and violence that is the hallmark of Dragkhanic society. Visitors to their lands often arrive heavily armed and with a retinue of guards, for the lone traveler is a target for slavers and brigands - there are many merchants and diplomats who have thought themselves safe from pillaging rovers, and yet are suprised to be spending their last days chained in a salt mine."

 orcish_a_group: "Rendun Orcs Heritage"
 orcish_a_group_desc: "The Isle of Rendun at the heart of the Central Omniluxian Sea is the original homeland of all Orcish people, with those who live on the island maintaining a distinctive culture from the many others orcs that live scattered across the world. The three main Clans on Rendun - the Ioleic, the Longonesi and the Parati - have long struggled for supremacy against each other, with their many wars of aggression sending many displaced Orcish refugees and slaves to foreign shores."

 orcish_b_group: "Remun Orcs Heritage"
 orcish_b_group_desc: "There are many orcs who have left their holy island of Remun over the centuries; some formed mercenary companies, joining their numbers with the levies gathering in strange lands, and others followed in the footsteps of their ancestors by migrating to Morrigon. In recent decades, armies from Rendun have attempted to conquer their kinsmen, but the orcs of Remun have managed to push back the invaders."

 copper_dwarves_group: "Copper Dwarves Heritage"
 copper_dwarves_group_desc: "'Copper' Dwarves have never lived underground like many of their cousins, choosing instead to build farms and cities on the surface and thus interacting with the human kingdoms around them. They are skillful builders and tough fighters, but for all of their physical hardness, they are said to enjoy the finer things in life, like silks and wine - rumors said only in whispers, lest they be heard by the infamously hotheaded Copper Dwarves."

 golden_dwarves_group: "Golden Dwarves Heritage"
 golden_dwarves_group_desc: "Golden Dwarves are the finest craftsmen of jewelry in all Omniluxia and unparalleled smiths, with merchants coming from as far away as Shall'shall'Ina to procure the gem-encrusted statues that are produced in the Dwarven workshops. Because of their skill working with precious metals, they have an unfair reputation for being greedy and they are resented by many of their neighbors, who accuse the Dwarves of hoarding their wealth and using it to fund wicked experiments within their cities."

 silver_dwarves_group: "Silver Dwarves Heritage"
 silver_dwarves_group_desc: "Ancestors of mountain-dwelling dwarves that lived far below the surface of Omniluxia, the Silver Dwarf is known to turn heads when appearing on the surface, for many men have never seen the bluish tint to their skin that gives them their name. Naturally healthy and of robust constitutions, they are clumsy fighters and not as sophisticated as their hill-dwelling cousins the Copper Dwarves."

 arteonian_group: "Arteonian Heritage"
 arteonian_group_desc: "The Arteonians are an ancient race, sharing many characteristics with both humans and elves - their blood is said to be full of magic. According to their legends, when the world was young and the gods struggled to contain the threat of the Dragons, there was a giant wyrm, a beast named Arteon, who was slain by the legendary hero Artheousan. As the dragon lay dying, its breath and blood coalesced into the form of a beautiful woman; a bride for the mighty Artheousan, and the mother of the first Arteonians."

 north_arteonian_group: "North Arteonian Heritage"
 north_arteonian_group_desc: "Centuries ago, there was a minor religious schism that divided the Arteonians into two groups, and although the Elders tried their best to mend the division within their society, when reconciliation was deemed impossible, it was decided that the splinter group should be expelled. The North Arteonians, as they have come to be known, still share many characteristics with their Arteonian cousins, yet they have developed their own traditions, dialects and sacred rituals."

 high_elves_group: "High Elves Heritage"
 high_elves_group_desc: "Haughty, cruel, arrogant, waspish - this short list of attributes describing the High Elves is definitely not a pleasant one, yet even the Elves would agree with how they are portrayed here. Notoriously suspicious of outsiders, High Elves nevertheless spend a great deal of time interacting with foreigners, particularly because they seem to be attempting to carve out an Empire for themselves. They are viewed with suspicion and fear by other Elves, and other races only bargain with them when they absolutely have to."

 forest_elves_group_1: "Deep Wood Elf Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_1_desc: "The Deep Wood Elves profess to be the oldest and wisest of their kind - a claim that is vehemently denied by the High Elves. Few have seen their homelands, the pristine forests of eastern Luxterra that are nestled high within the mountains, for the Deep Elves are highly suspicious of outsiders, especially the warmongering Werhenlanders. They maintain semi-friendly relations with the Common Dwarves, but as a rule, they do not trust most humans."

 forest_elves_group_2: "Forest Elf Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_2_desc: "While Forest Elves are respectful of the virgin woodlands that comprises their homeland, they have not let their religious affinities dictate their entire way of life; something that separates them from their cousins the Deep Wood Elves and the more extreme Followers of the Forest. Forest Elves can be found within many of the cities throughout Omniluxia, and if one personally knows an Elf, it is likely that they claim the Forest Heritage."

 forest_elves_group_3: "Nonaho Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_3_desc: "Those who have allowed their past identities to be subsumed by Mother Nature are never saddened by the loss of their previous lives, but instead find a beauty and a freedom in the Forest that is unmatched by anything that they have ever experienced before. The Nonaho, or True Followers of the Forest, can only begrudgingly be found within cities and walls, choosing instead to feel the soft grass of a shaded grove beneath their bared feet instead."

 western_half_elves_group: "Heritage of the Dinaril"
 western_half_elves_group_desc: "The Western Half Elves are children of former forest elvish slaves and freemen with Vetalians of the north. Depending on their birthplace they can adapt to both human and elven societies, and can be found in small communities across Vetalia. However, over the centuries they have coalesced into their own societies focused around urban centers called Dinaril, and are often called upon by neighboring countries and Dinaril as mercenaries."

 northlanders_group: "Northlanders Heritage"
 northlanders_group_desc: "A breakaway cultural group from the Norrfallians, the Northlanders rejected the soft, civilizing influences that were pervasive within the corrupt Norrfallian society and chose to pursue a simpler way of life instead. When the angry Norrfallians attacked their barbarous cousins, hoping to bring them back within their fold as slaves, they were defeated in battle by the Northlander berserkers, who hold a special place in Northlander society to this day. The mere thought of the Berserker, dressed from head to toe in furs, their face streaked with woad and a prayer of destruction on their lips, has been known to strike terror in the hearts of Norrfallians."

 borderlander_group: "Borderlander Heritage"
 borderlander_group_desc: "Borderlanders have long fought to keep their identities separate from the twin juggernauts of the Soventeir and Nazani Empires that surround them, and although they are just as likely to fight amongst themselves as they are to join together to repel invaders, they are faithful friends and unforgiving enemies."

 celtican_group: "Celtican Heritage"
 celtican_group_desc: "While many tribes continue to wander the face of Omniluxia, following the stars as they search for good grazing land, some people, like the Celticans, have abandoned their formerly savage ways for good, with many choosing to permanently settle in the expansive forests that have been their home for centuries. They still retain many of the habits of their nomadic forebears, however; many live in isolated, scattered communities, which has historically contributed to the dearth of manpower that has plagued their armies."

 vetalian_group: "Vetalian Heritage"
 vetalian_group_desc: "The Vetalians are the descendents of those that resisted the overtures of the Zani colonists, turning away from the stranger's gifts of gold and gems and remaining separate as a people. While some of their kinsmen gave their daughters to the sons of the foreigners, the Vetalians kept to the Old Ways, albeit for naught - they soon suffered many ignoble defeats, overwhelmed by the Nazani technology that decimated their ranks and drove them from their ancestral homes."

 zinduidian_group: "Zinduidian Heritage"
 zinduidian_group_desc: "The tribes of the Zinduidian people have long ignored the goings-on around them, preferring instead to focus on their internal affairs and allowing their squabbling neighbors to continue their petty wars against each other. If disaster threatens their people, however, then they are quick to ride to each other's aid, for they are unwilling to allow others to hold sway over them. While they are said to have originated from the deserts, their domains now include fertile farmlands and wide, expansive plains. Over the years, the Jarenam Empire has hired many Zinduidian mercenaries on their behalf, for none know the southern coasts like they do."
 
 kinones_group: "Kinones Heritage"
 kinones_group_desc: "The jovial Kinones are distant relatives of the human race that appear to be far less aggressive than their human counterparts. They are a bit shorter, but tougher than the average human, and Kinones are, as a rule, generally taller than dwarves. Kinones live simple lives in their peaceful valleys and work to create prosperous places for their kinsmen to live - they are far more focused on their economy and agriculture than their neighbors."

 etaredican_group: "Etaredican Heritage"
 etaredican_group_desc: "An ancient people, the Etaredicans are descended from the first humans to arrive in Western Luxterra, eventually being pushed to their forested homelands by other groups. Theirs is a history of independence, fighting off even the great Zani as their rough terrain made any campaign too costly for invading armies. However, the sheer size and speed of the fleeing Esquelians overwhelmed them, and most have been displaced, worshiping foreign gods and speaking foreign tongues. Those who remain after this tragedy have been hardened by war and oppression, and remain steadfast in their dedication to preserve their culture and retake their homeland."

 zarakens_group: "Zarakens Heritage"
 zarakens_group_desc: "The identity of the Zarakens was forged during a time of crisis for their people; religious conflicts were brought by the Prophets of the Zainudians and the Zarakens were one of the first groups to convert en masse, hoping to find a source of strength with the strange new heresy. Said to be lovers of money first and foremost - undoubtedly a slur against their willingness to fight for their faith - the Zarakens are Horselords, unbridled masters of heavy cavalry."

 phanician_group: "Phanician Heritage"
 phanician_group_desc: "After centuries foreign domination, first by the Zani then by the cruel Jarenam Empire, the Phanician traders took advantage of the death of Jarenam the Formidable to finally create independent states of their own. However, these two rump states are a pale imitation of what was once a great trading nation, whose colonies flourished even under Zani rule. Their naval traditions, outdated after centuries of decay, and the suffocating influence of the wealthy Phanician nobility have stifled innovation for centuries. Once rivaling even the Ular-Pria as the best sailors in Omniluxia, the ashamed Phanicians seek to reclaim their former glory after centuries of watching from the sidelines."

 esquelian_group: "Esquelian Heritage"
 esquelian_group_desc: "Related to the Phanicians, the Esquelians were the original inhabitants of the coasts of Bhaxnmrechtem pushed to the inner forests by the cruel Jarenam Empire, displacing most of the native Etaredicans. Natural merchants, their knack for learning foreign tongues and oratory skills made them highly sought after diplomats and administrators during Zani rule. Hiding in their forests and mountains, they are seen as too costly to conquer for the already unstable Jarenam Empire, and are hated by their Etaredican neighbors. Relying upon their diplomatic skills for survival in a tumultuous world, the Esquelians might yet hope to carve out a strong independent state, or even return to their homelands."

No one knows how they became the way they are, but some historians suggest the snakefolk once inhabited all of Omniluxia long before the inception of the human race. Abandoned snake temples, the ominous remains of a time long past, can be found all over Omniluxia. No one has dared to disturb the snakefolk on their islands for centuries, as they are known to kill all who enter their lands with no remorse - not even the Zani Empire dared to impose themselves upon the snakefolk tribes. The only humans the snakefolk traditionally interact with are their fellow Austropetolians, who mostly reside on the north of the archipelago, and over many centuries of coexisting, there has developed a hybrid human-snakefolk society. For much of history, the snakefolk tribes have been heavily decentralized, but recently a great number of snakefolk have united under the name of the Euryalid Kingdom and are starting to send diplomatic missions to outsiders. To many, this is a cause for great concern, for the true intentions and nature of the snakefolk have always been shrouded in mystery..."

Hundreds of years ago, the Horteonians sailed from their harsh island and invaded Arteon and Eptelon, and although they were mighty conquerors that carved out many kingdoms, within a few generations, they abandoned their traditional Hortenic faith for the worship of the Wyrm-Slayer. Artheousan missionaries managed to successfully convert the Horteonians, and they have eagerly embraced the religion, spreading it through the lands they seized by fire and the sword."

While they once controlled all of their homelands, their power has fractured over time,no doubt due to their horrendous infighting, although it shows some signs of coalescing once more.

Admittedly brutish in behavior and sometimes coming across as unpleasant in manner to those that they do not respect, Hobgoblins have thick yellow skin, reptilian eyes and are as tall as the average person, but are slightly stronger than their human counterparts. Although they are rumored to inhabit caves and other distant mountain valleys, they can mostly be found in the inner Dragon Pass, where they have ruled for as long as anyone can remember. Hobgoblin society is organized around a complex web of tribal blood oaths and ritualized religious observances, and there is a certain unspoken hierarchy in the village that is respected and acknowledged by all members of their community. They are exceedingly hostile to outsiders, killing all that enter their lands without their explicit permission, and perhaps with good reason - in the years past, many isolated Hobgoblin communities have been the victims of pogroms by outsiders, who have burned their villages and slaughtered their people without mercy and without provocation. Grimly determined to survive in a world that doesn't seem to have any room for them, the Hobgoblin cultures struggle against the dying of their light and are obsessed with preserving their way of life."

 drow_heritage: "Drow Heritage"
 drow_heritage_desc:0 "The Drow, also known as 'Dark Elves', are among the many ancient races of Omniluxia. Stories as old as time tell tales of the origin of these strange elves; it is said that at one point they looked and behaved just like the High Elves of Horteon. Records speak of a small contingency of High Elves who departed from Horteon for more fruitful lands and, after sailing for years, they finally settled deep in the mountains of Northeast Luxterra. Although these new lands were cold and harsh, the elves found that they had everything they needed. They lived in peace for many years to come until several great calamities befell them; first, earthquakes destroyed their homes and then a great pestilence came, which nearly killed all of the elves. With only a small group of elves remaining, the surrounding Northlander tribes descended upon them at night, slaughtering all who were not fortunate enough to escape. It is said that only fifty elves escaped that day; surrounded by enemies and with nowhere to go, they decided to flee deep into the intricate cave systems of the surrounding mountains.\n\nIn these caves there was no light, no people, and many thought there was no hope for the remaining survivors. After several days of trekking through the cave system, the elves found an underwater lake several thousand meters below ground, and with this they found hope,  as it contained fresh water, a strangely tasty species of cave fish, and hundreds of types of edible mushrooms. It was here that the small tribe of elves would live for thousands of years, trapped beneath the ground with no way out but enjoying at peace at last. Over time, the lack of sunlight and some strange elements of the mushrooms that they consumed transformed the elves into something entirely different from their original High Elf descendants...their eyes became black and their skin began to develop an otherworldly purple hue, and they began to worship the primordial forces of darkness. In a sunless land, they lived peacefully until the Great Collapse destroyed much of their underground habitat...but it also reopened the way out of the caves. Out of necessity, the Drow ascended back to the surface and once again established themselves along the outskirts of the mountains of Luxterra. The local inhabitants immediately vacated the area as they were terrified of their strange appearance. The Drow never let any of the locals close to them ever again, savagely killing all who entered their lands. In recent years, some of the Northlanders have begun to interact with the Drow and some have come to accept their religion as their own, spreading the reverence for the dark forces throughout Northeast Luxterra."

Unfortunately, this sense of devotion towards the latest Velkopic prophet does not extend beyond the core peoples of the league, and their harsh regulations have thus marginalized those outsider groups who have come under the governance of their Euryalean conquerors, forcing those able-bodied among the dissatisfied to turn towards a life of maritime anarchy in opposition of their legalistic overlords."
