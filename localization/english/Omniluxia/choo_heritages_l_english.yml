 aralan_group: "Aralans Heritage"
 aralan_group_desc: "Steadfast and brave, the Aralans people were Wildlander mercenaries employed by the Zani to secure and stabilize the Imperial province of Rohenoa from the unruly Rohenoans. Promised land in exchange for their services, they settled down and created small communities across Rohevia and Rohenoa. When the Zani abandoned the province, the Aralans were forced to fend for themselves, and while many swore fealty to the Merovingi kings, there were those who decided not to stick with their kinsmen to avoid the wars that engulfed the peninsula. These are the Aralans, who are loyal to themselves first and foremost." 

 geallian_group: "Geallian Heritage"
 geallian_group_desc: "The Geallians appear in the histories and records of many of the surrounding nations, for these people have had an outsized influence on those around them. Known for their adventurous spirits and love of glory, Geallian heroes have long left the shores of their homeland to seek their destinies all throughout Omniluxia, with some being wildly successful and others fading unremembered into the endless night. Good warriors and even better traders, the only thing negative that can be said about the Geallians is that they are an unpious people - they are no lovers of the gods, but care mostly for themselves."

 beatepian_group: "Baetepian Heritage"
 beatepian_group_desc: "Within the lands of the Baetep, the House of Sertem has become the main powerbroker within the region, but this is not to say that there are not smaller groups that are powerful - the Baetepians are proof that Sertem supremacy is not a done deal. Whether or not the Baetepians will be able to preserve their unique culture remains to be seen, but they are clinging tenaciously to their ideals and have yet to be conquered."

 beatepian_upper_group: "Upper Baetepian Heritage"
 beatepian_upper_group_desc: "While the inexorable power of the House of Sertem is growing within Baetep, there are still cultural enclaves that have resisted the pressures to assimilate, and the Upper Baetapians are chief among those that refuse to bow their heads in submission. Luckily for them, they have many sons that are willing to fight to preserve their way of life; their manpower resources are said to dwarf those of their neighbors."

 intermarenican_group: "Intermarenican Heritage"
 intermarenican_group_desc: "The fecund farmlands and rolling plains that are surrounded by the Marenica Sea are the traditional homelands of the Intermarenicans, who have long thrived on the shores of that calm ocean. While not strong politically - there are dozens of Intermarenican petty kingdoms - they have been forced time and time again to repel the dreadful Razani, who have long sought to conquer the territories to their east."

 werhenlander_group: "Werhenlander Heritage"
 werhenlander_group_desc: "Werhenlanders are a noble people, with a culture that is guided by chivalric principles and lead by Knights, who are the top of Werhenlanded society. Said to be a dour and humorless people, it comes as a surprise to many to find that the taciturn Werhenlanders are faithful adherents of the Helluvian Faith, and in ages past, many Werhenlander Knights lead crusading armies against the heretics surrounding them."

 werhenssian_group: "Werhenssian Heritage"
 werhenssian_group_desc: "Werhenssian society is a beautiful enigma to outsiders, with many foreigners being captivated by their unique style and cultural traditions; indeed, the image of a bearded Werhenssian cavalryman, dressed in traditional flowing robes while riding his mount on the plains, is a romantic one that features in many Razani folktales. The Werhenssian are known for their fairness, with the stranger having the same rights within their society as blood kinsmen."

 rohenoan_group: "Rohenoan Heritage"
 rohenoan_group_desc: "The story of the Rohenoan people is one that is filled with countless wars, savage massacres and periods of enslavement, and over the years, this bloody history has created a culture that places a high value on military strength of arms. A well-equipped Rohenoan Knight, resplendent in head to toe in expensive gem-encrusted armor, is said to be one of the deadliest foes one could ever meet on the battlefield, for they are unrelenting in their assaults and fight with the ferocity of a people that bow their heads for no one. Bitter and laconic in temperament, the Rohenoans are known for their dry humor and their strong sense of honor."
 
 zani_vetalian_group: "Zani-Vetalian Heritage"
 zani_vetalian_group_desc: "Some Vetalians did not hide from the opportunities that the gods brought to their ancestors, choosing to show hospitality to the Zani colonists and ultimately changing the history of their nation forever. Over time, the sons and daughters of the two nations became as one, and these Zani-Vetalians soon drove their xenophobic cousins deep into the mountains, shattering their defensive leagues and taking the choicest lands for themselves."

 seeker_group: "Seeker Heritage"
 seeker_group_desc: "Rohenoan, Celtican, Vetalian, Zani - the Seekers have blood connections to all of these people, but they are not guided by any notion of kinship; the only thing that matters is what they Seek. Viewed as obsessive fundamentalists by many and described as joyless and intense, the Seekers have renounced their previous identities in order to fully embrace their religious ideals - a peculiarity that is viewed with suspicion by their neighboring communities."


######### MURDER LOC DO NOT TOUCH

 #aralan_group: "Aralanischoi Heritage"
 #aralan_group_desc: "In days long gone, when the heartland children of Zanis set about to conquer the earth and more, the forebears of the Aralanischoi were no different from the peoples who still call the lands of Werhenia their home. Their ancestors were thus not a singular people, and were instead a vast collection of disparate and trustless tribes who were united simply on the premise of foreign invasion. For the westerners came about and sought bloody domination of those homelands not belonging to them, and among the once tranquil nations were those of the East. After a generation of subjagating the people of Antorima, the war-machine of the Geallaiaus saw to it that trade within the Psotesmira Sea be sanctified under their sole authority. For even before the legionary standard was struck along the eastern coast, the Zanites had declared concord with many of the Werhenisch tribes who inhabited those idyllic lands. This ensured that the natives would neither send good of arms towards their western neighbors, nor would they seek to enlist their able-bodied youth within conflicts concerning the imperial conquest of Antorima. As such, the brutal colonization that would arrive thereafter proved all the more unexpected and humilating in the eyes of the coastal peoples. Try as they did, the Werhenisch could not withstand the legions of Geallaiaus brawn, and their children were thus incorporated into the colonial framework of the West. Regardless of the wounds inflicted by war, the Zanites admired their barbarian subjects for their ability in all things combative, and thus exported their sons across the empire. They were brought westward most especially, in the realm of Rohenoa where the nigh-unstoppable legions of Geallaia were being halted steadfast by unwavering insurgency. Thus cemented the identity of the Aralanischoi, a class onto themselves whose duties were to police the conquered masses when the fires of war were left dimmed. Even after the will of Imperium Geallaia had waned across the region, the Aralanischoi prevailed within this new world order, carving out for themselves a number of remnant states that continue to hold out against their rival neighbors." 

 #geallian_group: "Geallian Heritage"
 #geallian_group_desc: "A family of insular and agrarian cultures united in their shared heritage forged from generations of hardship and Imperial creed, the Geallaiaus are a people well acquainted with the laws of this cruel world, knowing full well that it devours the meek and lonesome. Possessed of a past as sordid as any other race, the minds of their greatest scholars are just barely able to retain each and every history that concerns those petty monarchies and communes of the past. The only difference being was that, among the Geallaiaus, there were those provident figures who grew wise to the march of time, seeing to it that they would come to triumph above all obstacles. Among them was Sumun the Dromedary King, Calaganu the Mage Price, Bolaeda the Seamstress of Fate, Phidinater the Lunar Duke, and many more. Born within a time of great magic and even greater myths, each one of these ancient legends all had their own stories to tell. Yet, the greatest and most beloved of ancestors among the Geallaiaus still lives on, remembered by more than just historians and old men. For his name is now stationed eternally in the realms of heaven and beyond, brought there by ascent of his own making and vice. He is Zanis the Young, Zanis the Blooded, Zanis the Wise, and above all else in the eyes of his people, he is Zanis the Great. Born to an an age that consumed the spirits of lesser men, Zanis was compelled by a vision of foreign lands, seeking to expand the borders of his world and into the unknown. Through him did the citizens of Geallaia become the undisputed masters of the world for a time that spanned centuries, their name becoming just as eternal as that of their Purple-Emperor within the eyes of all foreigners, subject or otherwise. Though their power has since fragmented, their god-chosen name, now rusted with the tint of decline caused by the Great Collapse, the mark of Geallaiaus authority and custom is still fresh across the lands that once raised the Imperial flag from their castles and ramparts."

 #beatepian_group: "Shiyat-Baetepite Heritage"
 #beatepian_group_desc: "Situated at the crossroads of many worlds, the East and the West, the North and the South, the denizens of Shiyat-Baetep are among some of the most ancient peoples present in all of western Luxterra. The descendents of a venerable race, their constituent cultures are among some of the last members of the Nutesherite languages, one of the many native tongues that had permeated the land long before the arrival of the camel-nomads. For when the hordes of the Zarekintu, Aqalasor, Qelakusin, Aladjir, and Druny-Kurej had just settled their ilk all across the continent, the territories of Shiyat-Baetep, Keth-Baetep, and Gymaza were already one state, its name connected to an ancient and revered history that had long influenced peoples far throughout the pre-Luxterran earth. As such, the legend of these mighty ancients preservers into the modern day, ringing golden even within this world now dominated by the memory of the Purple-Emperors. Yet, for all this glory and prestige, so too was the authority of Shiyat-Baetep once young and humble. Beginning under the auspice of a single king whose blood was that of the brackisch waters to the North, beheld of a name that sought respect lest blood be spilt in his honor. He was the namesake of his people's language, he was the slayer of crocodiles and demons, he was the uniter of the two peoples once divided, he was the lord of the Djardur. He was Nuther-Sherin I of the Bahabru dynasty, ancestor to all the ruling families that proceeded him within his beloved Shiyat-Baetep. With a will clad in divine providence, he made kneel his neighbors from as far north to the forebears of the Baetepos, from as far west to the cities of Faniqiwa, from as far south to the temples of Keth, from as far east to the chiefdoms of the Verne. Though his descendents have known nothing but foreign rule since the war with the Sertemuwites, to both themselves and many other peoples, the Shiyat-Baetepites are a nation to be respected for all that they have achieved."

 #beatepian_upper_group: "Keth-Baetepite Heritage"
 #beatepian_upper_group_desc: "The nigh-isolated denizens of Keth-Baetep, their homeland is named such on account of the chief god of their divine-household, Keth the Vermillion Vulture. However, such a term had been forced upon them by the mouths of foreign conquerors who denoted these peoples by the distinctions within their worship, for in the past the Baetepites of the South were made subjects of the burdgeoning power of Shiyat-Baetep by decree of conquest under the legendary Nuther-Sherin I. He brought with him the word of his deity, Shiyat the All-Beast, and for many generations the indigenous cult of Keth was repeatedly forced into hiding by the force of militant clerics, yet still this did not kill the spirit of the Vermilion Vulture. Taking with him a number of loyal followers, Keth had chosen to flee deep into the valleys of the Golden Mountains, waiting for a time for when he may return and seek vengence against the lords of Shiyat-Baetep. As for his subjects he left behind, his children chose to forgo their ancient service to the old divinities, bowing to the customs of their distant Pharon. Within time the distinction between these two cousin-peoples of the North and the South began to blur, reemerging only after the Gymaza War which saw much of Shiyat-Baetep fall into the control of the Faniqia warlord Sertem II. In time, the will of foreign gods within the South had weakened as the now independent governors initiated an age of warlords, desperately fighting to claim for themselves whatever power they could muster. In the chaos of their bickering they had invited back the influence of the Vermilion Vulture down from the mountains, bringing with him an army of darkened warriors who rained clouds of arrows upon their enemies. Though the descendents of this great force have since disappeared amidst the peoples of Keth-Baetep, the Vermilion Vulture now stands as the predominant god along the southern cataracts once more, inspiring a golden age even throughout the Zanite invasions."

 #intermarenican_group: "Aentora-Muerixos Heritage"
 #intermarenican_group_desc: "Preached by the twin-goddesses of the earth and moon, Aentora and Muerixe, and yet their pious children have always had an infamous reputation across nigh-all of Omniluxia. Known as slavers, pirates, and even the thieves of homelands, they had obtained this image of wanton cruelty throughout the course of their bloody capture at the hands of Imperium Geallaia. Annihilated without mercy, the children of slain men and raped women grew to know nothing more than the iron will of the West, becoming dull to the humiliation that came with it. In time, the proceeding generations of Aentora-Muerixos became sworn collaborators within their new imperial society, doing upon their eastern neighbors what had befell their own ancestors. Regardless, for all that has become of the descendents from that oppressive era, the majority of Anotrima's history has always been a collection of legendary heroics and intellectualism. Composed of great myths about heroes who rose by the sword and shield in lieu of prostration to the tyrants of old, their memory is accompanied by the names of those sagely men and women who contributed greatly to the wealth of knowledge that persists among their modern disciples. Even within the beating heart of Geallaia during times both classical and contemporary, where one would expect to find the culturally insular Geallaiaus to shun all foreign influence, does the ancient prominence of the Antorima stand firm within the hearts and minds of scholars alike. Famous of all the pre-Helluv saints from the East are of course the brothers Kyriam and Pelixes, who were sent by their divine father, Kulnosis the Everything-King, in order to liberate the land from the uncouth rule of the Luxter barbarians who had swept over Antorima in a terrible ire. Though it has been many generation since the impact of these mighty heroes would have been most felt, this mythos concerned chiefly with the collective liberty of the Aentora-Muerixos has always been at the forefront of countless conflicts within their homeland fair, the most recent culmination of such sentiment being the great Kalixoi Rebellion which saw Razanisch sway over the region be expelled."

 #werhenlander_group: "Werhenisch Heritage"
 #werhenlander_group_desc: "Inheritors to the sacred rites of the Volviekar, the Werhenisch are historically attested by both themselves and their inhuman neighbors to have been the first men present within all of modern Werhenia. Spurned forward into migration due to both spiritual and environmental upheavel, their mythos claims that the sages of the two families Bothuar and Fiyaluer foresaw a great calamity that would befall the East and all her people. Guiding their disciples many, each generation of wise-men would shepard their people ever farther from their old home, arriving westard within woodlands tall. It was here did the Werhenisch encounter the kingdoms of the fae, and in time would go to war with them in honor of the old rivalries between their respective gods. Though hostilities have since ended between these two peoples and their divine-households, many among the opportunistic nobility of either race find this to be tentative at best. As such, those families who sit along the borders of their sequential homelands continue to stir ever vigilant, the tranquility among these outskirt settlements being tended to by the half-elves who wish to see their scion peoples find concord betwixt this brewing unrest. Regardless, the Werhenisch peoples remain ever jovial in their dealings amongst themselves when the threat of war does not loom above their families, for as custom demands, the oaths of friendship between one's direct family and neighborly kin must always be upheld within Werhenia. This kindly attitude, however, was neither returned nor well recieved on part of the Geallaiaus legions. After the conquest of Antorima, the Purple-Emperor Domeniras declared a bloody campaign upon the kingdom of Lux after he had accused the its king of inciting revolt among the Aentora-Muerixos. So began a series of brutal wars that engendered chaos among the states of Werhenia, the standard of the imperial army leaving atrocity in its wake. Yet, it was through this impovrishment under western rule did the teachings of Helluv dig itself deeply amidst the scarred masses, eventually leading to the first Helluvite Crusade which saw the foreigners chased away after the Great Collapse."

 #werhenssian_group: "Huar'Ensuya Heritage"
 #werhenssian_group_desc: "During generations long past, the ancient Volviekar undertook a perilous migration that saw themselves leave the eastern taigas of their homeland, spreading west into lands already inhabited by a number of foreign races. Among the localities they ventured to were the forests of Werhenia, of which at the time were inhabited solely by the Paeyok elfs who had been there since an era now forgotten. The two races would succeed their gods by those ancient grudges that were endemic to the mythic past, going to war with one another for much of their shared history. Yet, from this bounty of hatred and suffering emerged a preacher born of kindly qualities, for within his spirit simmered both mannish and elfish blood. His name was Hua'Raeong, the legendary half-elf who became a god through virtue of his pain and compassion. He was sired by the loving union between a Paeyok demi-god, Hyoong'Ri the lord of Gyurong, and a human princess, Jyrbela of the clan Woluwieska. Their love, however, was destined to be admonished by all who adhered to the rigid bitterness that plagued all of Werhenia, for soon word of their affair would reach all the way to the heavens themselves. What happened next would be an epic in of itself, but regardless of the events of the past, their son would go on to defy the courts of the Werhenisch and Paeyok pantheons, establishing for himself and his followers a strip of land that dangled upon the borders of the mannisch and elfish worlds. His haven would prove itself attractive to many disparate souls who found themselves lost upon the auspice of ceaseless warfare, whose circumstances crossed the boundaries that separated humans and fae. In time, Hua'Raeong would teach his flock to forgo the troubles of their ancestors, and instead embark upon the genesis of a new people founded upon the ideals of altruistic virtue and boundless forgivenss. Thus was born the Huar'Ensuya, the half-elfs of the Werhenisch woodlands, who keep steady the peace between their parent races."

 #rohenoan_group: "Rohevirex Heritage"
 #rohenoan_group_desc: "However pervasive be the words of Helluv and Zanis within westward Rohenoa, there yet remains a tint of the old faith upheld by those clergies of foreign cloth. Within the surviving mythos of the ancient Rohevirex, it is said that in the mythic past there spewed forth from the mouth of Heaven rivers of godly blood, for the father of all humanity, Volvaio the Tall-Man, was slain upon the orders of his beloved brother, Aedious the Elf-King. Volvaio's followers thus fled the upper cosmos as they took with them his holy corpse, descending into the caves of lowly Omniluxia where they would bury their fallen god. When they emerged from those hallowed paths, the darkness of the underground had stripped them naked of immortal grace, and so were born the first men. The unity between these ancients, however, was not meant to last, for some had left in search of new lands while others chose to stand guard over the grave of their scion. Those who remained stayed in what would become the continent of Morrigon, and are thus said to be the forebears of the Rohevirex and their sisterly neighbors to the south. Regardless of the validity to such myths, the human peoples of this western land can truly be called its first inhabitants, their nativity attested by the histories of the dragonic men, the murals of the dwarfen smiths, the tapestries of the black-eyed fae, and even by word of the orcs and goblins. Yet, out of all the nations endemic to fair Morrigon, the Rohevirex are perhaps the ones with the most infamous of histories. For when the Geallaiaus first set foot upon Rohenoan shores, they were enamored to discover a panoply of magnificent cities who rivalled those of their own. Of course, such beauty was not meant to last, for all things that stood under the sun were to be made kneeling below Imperium Geallaia. Though the Rohevirex would fight valiantly against this foreign invasion, their spirits eventually dimmed as the imperial armies of the East blew over them like a storm. For their defiance, the peoples of Rohenoa would suffer greatly at the hands of the Purple-Emperor and his legions, their homeland now policed and occupied by the belligerent Aralanischoi. Though politicaly, Rohenoa has since changed after the Merovingi uprising, the Rohevirex will fight onward for their sovereignty even against their former governors."

 #zani_vetalian_group: "Geallo-Vetalicsi Heritage"
 #zani_vetalian_group_desc: "With the coming of the Geallaiaus to the West and the planting of their legionary banner upon foreign soil, the many nations they encountered were in time forced to kneel before the diadem of Imperium Geallaia. Yet, there exists an exception to this history of ceaseless conquest and ruin, as evident by those kindly kingdoms of Vetaicu, whose genesis was founded upon saintly whims. For whereas the Geallo-Weaglucsi represent the conjoining of native bloodlines with the traditions of their eastward conquerors by forecful integration, the identity of the Geallo-Vetalicsi had coalesced through an exceptional tolerance on part of the western polities in the face of alien travelers. When the cruelties of the colonial government had grown too much to bear, many settlers would flee past the imperial borders and into the arms of the disparate tribes who burned with hatred for the Purple-Emperor. Though many many among them would be taken as slaves, or worst, those who chanced upon the beaches of Vetalicu were embraced by its hospitable locals. As the generations passed, the cultural distinctions between both native and migrant peoples began to blur, forming a hybrid and yet ultimately endemic culture upon those westward shores. This enculteration was not one-sided, however, for whilst much of Geallo-Vetalicsu heritage can be traced back to the customs of their indigenous forebears, the Geallaiaus would return this influence tenfold through the seeding of foreign ideas among their native kinsmen. With a well established metallurgy tradition already present across the lands, the birth of the Geallo-Vetalicsu is said to have begun through a rapid adoption of iron in lieu of traditional bronze alloys, culminating in a technological revolution that would forevermore stand as testament to the mark of Luxterran influence. While many foreign observers would claim that this be the sole reason as for the repelling of the Zanite invasions, going so far as to claim that the colonial endeavor was a success by proxy of those dissident settlers, the peoples of the westward shores will always pride themseves upon the complexity of their many bloodlines."

 #seeker_group: "Geallao-Cerwainite Heritage"
 #seeker_group_desc: "A mongrel people, dubbed so by the harsh words of their eastern kin, the Geallo-Cerwainites live as testament to the providence bequeath upon the ancient Seeker-Mages. Drawing cloth from the likes of the Caledurox, the Beladunix, the Lupinorax, and even those inhuman races such as the Neyol-Qureg, the word of the Prophet Cerwain and his predecessors rang true amidst those tribes indigenous to the Dragon Valley. ."

 eastern_zerywani_group: "Hulskveg Heritage"
 eastern_zerywani_group_desc: "Once upon a time, the plains of eastern Luxterra were inhabited solely by one race, unrelated to the nomads who now inhabit these lands. Named the Zerywanie by the spirits of the earth, these ancients were denoted to be a kind and humble people within the annals of their neighbors. Ruling across the steppes within earthen castles of great splendor, the remains of these structures are a testament to the great manpower these people were able to command back in their heydey. Yet, for all their material achievements and divine favor, none of it was enough in order to stave off the wrath of their enemies. Compelled forward by the onset of the Dragon Resurgence, the peoples of the northern valleys came down upon the forts and villages of the peaceful Zerywanie, riding upon bronze chariots as they fled the slughter at the hand of the Durokregir. In doing so they overran the tribes of the steppes, sending their victims fleeing to the south. Among the desperate warriors who still fought on, there was Hulskva the Defender. A great general of the confederation of Vuraspeya, for a time he proved to be the last great hero fighting against the rising threat of invasion, defeating each and every terrible horde who had come against him in arms. Yet, for all his military providence, he had shone too brightly in face of his leering king, and was thus exiled alongside his army. Too kindly to return his scorn upon the innocents of his nation, he fought on for many years independant of his former liege, but without the wealth of his people to keep his men fed, in time his efforts began to falter. Through a final decision that would seal the genesis of the Hulskveg, he took with him hundreds upon thousands of the Vurespeyans, leading them southwards into the arms of snowy forests that would render the steeds of their enemies useless against them. It is here do his descendents remain, living defiantly against both the nomads and former kin who continue to roam the plains, the tensions between these three peoples being ever eternal."

 western_zerywani_group: "Prawocitzie Heritage"
 western_zerywani_group_desc: "By blood and right does this race proclaim itself the people of Prawocy, the last king of a united Zerywanie nation within their steppe motherland. From birth do the aristocrats of these belligerent clans pledge themselves to the spirits of the wind and sky, holding steady the great cobble-mounds that keep at bay those camel-riders to the North. This duty to the heavens alone is practiced even among their lesser bondsmen, for this shared piety was forged in a time of great change and even greater suffering. When the gods of the soil and stones could not protect their wards any longer from the devestation wrought upon them at the hands of barbarous invaders, the last living son of Huslaw II of Vuraspeya, Bulstycow the Bastard, overthrew the ancient and divinely-granted rule of his father's bloodline. Forsaking his paternal heritage for that of his mother's household, he made a pact with the spirits of the blue skies and thus received aid in the form of horses, gryphons, and dogs. Yet, when he led his army of beasts and men against his enemies, the young king was struck dead under a blanket of arrows that dared cover the light of the sun itself. Though the battle was won that day by the efforts of the late king's cousins, the realm was torn asunder by a resurgent dynastic crisis, leaving the pieces to be picked up by Prawocy of the house Luspiw, inheritor of his father's pact with the heavenly lords. Living a life of dangerous adventure, in the end Prawocy grew to be an old yet wisened leader who had reunited Vurespeya and the other Zerywani lands, abandoning the petty troubles that brewed amongst the nobles of his people. Though the camel-riders have since retaken many lands from his lesser descendents, and Vurespeya may no longer exist, Prawocy is still held in the highest regard among the Zerywannie of the steppes."

 norrfallian_group: "Norrfallian Heritage"
 norrfallian_group_desc: "Norrfallians are the natives of the northeastern peninsula of Luxterra, having long ago established the monarchies and kingdoms that are the seat of their power. Although they have a storied history that is filled with heroic tales of conquest and splendor, as of late, their recent past has been defined by their struggles against the breakaway Northlanders, who have humbled their civilized cousins on the battlefield more times than the Norrfallians would like to remember."

 errnorfallian_group: "Errnorfallian Heritage"
 errnorfallian_group_desc: "The Errnorfallians are distant kinsmen to both the Norrfallians and the Northlanders, and over the years, they have fought against both of these nations. While they retain some cultural similarities, their religious practices are quite different; their beliefs are diverse, with many smaller religious communities thriving within their traditional homelands. The Errnorfallians are wary of the High Elven colonies on their coasts, and it is believed that war between their people is an inevitability."

 dragkhanic_group: "Dragkhanic Heritage"
 dragkhanic_group_desc: "'To be born Dragkhanic is to live with one foot in the grave', as the old saying goes. Yet even this aphorism does not do justice to the cruelty and violence that is the hallmark of Dragkhanic society. Visitors to their lands often arrive heavily armed and with a retinue of guards, for the lone traveler is a target for slavers and brigands - there are many merchants and diplomats who have thought themselves safe from pillaging rovers, and yet are suprised to be spending their last days chained in a salt mine."

 orcish_group: "Orktoshor Heritage"
 orcish_group_desc: "The Isle of Rendun at the heart of the Central Omniluxian Sea is the original homeland of all Orcish people, with those who live on the island maintaining a distinctive culture from the many others orcs that live scattered across the world. The three main Clans on Rendun - the Ioleic, the Longonesi and the Parati - have long struggled for supremacy against each other, with their many wars of aggression sending many displaced Orcish refugees and slaves to foreign shores."

 orcish_humano_group_desc: "There are many orcs who have left their holy island of Remun over the centuries; some formed mercenary companies, joining their numbers with the levies gathering in strange lands, and others followed in the footsteps of their ancestors by migrating to Morrigon. In recent decades, armies from Rendun have attempted to conquer their kinsmen, but the orcs of Remun have managed to push back the invaders."

 copper_dwarves_group: "Copper Dwarves Heritage"
 copper_dwarves_group_desc: "'Copper' Dwarves have never lived underground like many of their cousins, choosing instead to build farms and cities on the surface and thus interacting with the human kingdoms around them. They are skillful builders and tough fighters, but for all of their physical hardness, they are said to enjoy the finer things in life, like silks and wine - rumors said only in whispers, lest they be heard by the infamously hotheaded Copper Dwarves."

 golden_dwarves_group: "Gold Dwarves Heritage"
 golden_dwarves_group_desc: "Golden Dwarves are the finest craftsmen of jewelry in all Omniluxia and unparalleled smiths, with merchants coming from as far away as Shall'shall'Ina to procure the gem-encrusted statues that are produced in the Dwarven workshops. Because of their skill working with precious metals, they have an unfair reputation for being greedy and they are resented by many of their neighbors, who accuse the Dwarves of hoarding their wealth and using it to fund wicked experiments within their cities."

 silver_dwarves_group: "Silver Dwarves Heritage"
 silver_dwarves_group_desc: "Ancestors of mountain-dwelling dwarves that lived far below the surface of Omniluxia, the Silver Dwarf is known to turn heads when appearing on the surface, for many men have never seen the bluish tint to their skin that gives them their name. Naturally healthy and of robust constitutions, they are clumsy fighters and not as sophisticated as their hill-dwelling cousins the Copper Dwarves."

 arteonian_group: "Arteonians Heritage"
 arteonian_group_desc: "The Arteonians are an ancient race, sharing many characteristics with both humans and elves - their blood is said to be full of magic. According to their legends, when the world was young and the gods struggled to contain the threat of the Dragons, there was a giant wyrm, a beast named Arteon, who was slain by the legendary hero Artheousan. As the dragon lay dying, its breath and blood coalesced into the form of a beautiful woman; a bride for the mighty Artheousan, and the mother of the first Arteonians."

 north_arteonian_group_desc: "Centuries ago, there was a minor religious schism that divided the Arteonians into two groups, and although the Elders tried their best to mend the division within their society, when reconciliation was deemed impossible, it was decided that the splinter group should be expelled. The North Arteonians, as they have come to be known, still share many characteristics with their Arteonian cousins, yet they have developed their own traditions, dialects and sacred rituals."

 high_elves_group: "High Elves Heritage"
 high_elves_group_desc: "Haughty, cruel, arrogant, waspish - this short list of attributes describing the High Elves is definitely not a pleasant one, yet even the Elves would agree with how they are portrayed here. Notoriously suspicious of outsiders, High Elves nevertheless spend a great deal of time interacting with foreigners, particularly because they seem to be attempting to carve out an Empire for themselves. They are viewed with suspicion and fear by other Elves, and other races only bargain with them when they absolutely have to."

 forest_elves_group_1: "Deepwood Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_1_desc: "The Deep Wood Elves profess to be the oldest and wisest of their kind - a claim that is vehemently denied by the High Elves. Few have seen their homelands, the pristine forests of eastern Luxterra that are nestled high within the mountains, for the Deep Elves are highly suspicious of outsiders, especially the warmongering Werhenlanders. They maintain semi-friendly relations with the Common Dwarves, but as a rule, they do not trust most humans."

 forest_elves_group_2: "Leshmian Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_2_desc: "While Wood Elves are respectful of the virgin woodlands that comprises their homeland, they have not let their religious affinities dictate their entire way of life; something that separates them from their cousins the Deep Wood Elves and the more extreme Followers of the Forest. Wood Elves can be found within many of the cities throughout Omniluxia, and if one personally knows an Elf, it is likely that they claim the Forest group."

 forest_elves_group_3: "Nonaho Heritage"
 forest_elves_group_3_desc: "Those who have allowed their past identities to be subsumed by Mother Nature are never saddened by the loss of their previous lives, but instead find a beauty and a freedom in the Forest that is unmatched by anything that they have ever experienced before. The Nonaho, or True Followers of the Forest, can only begrudgingly be found within cities and walls, choosing instead to feel the soft grass of a shaded grove beneath their bared feet instead."

 western_half_elves_group: "Dinaril Heritage"
 western_half_elves_group_desc: "The Visenhoi Half Elves are children of former wood elven slaves and freemen with Vetalians of the north. Depending on their birthplace they can adapt to both human and elven societies, and can be found in small communities across Vetalia. However, over the centuries they have coalesced into their own societies focused around urban centers called Dinaril, and are often called upon by neighboring countries and Dinaril as mercenaries."

 northlanders_group: "Northlander Heritage"
 northlanders_group_desc: "A breakaway cultural group from the Norrfallians, the Northlanders rejected the soft, civilizing influences that were pervasive within the corrupt Norrfallian society and chose to pursue a simpler way of life instead. When the angry Norrfallians attacked their barbarous cousins, hoping to bring them back within their fold as slaves, they were defeated in battle by the Northlander berserkers, who hold a special place in Northlander society to this day. The mere thought of the Berserker, dressed from head to toe in furs, their face streaked with woad and a prayer of destruction on their lips, has been known to strike terror in the hearts of Norrfallians."

 borderlander_group: "Borderlander Heritage"
 borderlander_group_desc: "Borderlanders have long fought to keep their identities separate from the twin juggernauts of the Soventeir and Nazani Empires that surround them, and although they are just as likely to fight amongst themselves as they are to join together to repel invaders, they are faithful friends and unforgiving enemies."

 celtican_group: "Celtican Heritage"
 celtican_group_desc: "While many tribes continue to wander the face of Omniluxia, following the stars as they search for good grazing land, some people, like the Celticans, have abandoned their formerly savage ways for good, with many choosing to permanently settle in the expansive forests that have been their home for centuries. They still retain many of the habits of their nomadic forebears, however; many live in isolated, scattered communities, which has historically contributed to the dearth of manpower that has plagued their armies."

 vetalian_group: "Vetalian Heritage"
 vetalian_group_desc: "The Vetalians are the descendents of those that resisted the overtures of the Zani colonists, turning away from the stranger's gifts of gold and gems and remaining separate as a people. While some of their kinsmen gave their daughters to the sons of the foreigners, the Vetalians kept to the Old Ways, albeit for naught - they soon suffered many ignoble defeats, overwhelmed by the Nazani technology that decimated their ranks and drove them from their ancestral homes."

 zinduidian_group: "Zinduidian Heritage"
 zinduidian_group_desc: "The tribes of the Zinduidian people have long ignored the goings-on around them, preferring instead to focus on their internal affairs and allowing their squabbling neighbors to continue their petty wars against each other. If disaster threatens their people, however, then they are quick to ride to each other's aid, for they are unwilling to allow others to hold sway over them. While they are said to have originated from the deserts, their domains now include fertile farmlands and wide, expansive plains. Over the years, the Jarenam Empire has hired many Zinduidian mercenaries on their behalf, for none know the southern coasts like they do."
 
 kinones_group: "Kinones Heritage"
 kinones_group_desc: "The jovial Kinones, or Konimaru in their tongue, are distant relatives of the human race that appear to be far less aggressive than their human counterparts. They are a bit shorter, but tougher than the average human, and Kinones are, as a rule, generally taller than dwarves. Kinones live simple lives in their peaceful valleys and work to create prosperous places for their kinsmen to inhabit - they are far more focused on their economy and agriculture than their neighbors."

 etaredican_group: "Etaredicans Heritage"
 etaredican_group_desc: "An ancient people, the Etaredicans are descended from the first humans to arrive in Western Luxterra, eventually being pushed to their forested homelands by other groups. Theirs is a history of independence, fighting off even the great Zani as their rough terrain made any campaign too costly for invading armies. However, invasions by more populous peoples such as the Esquelians, Geallians, and later Bhaxans have have put pressure on their way of life. Some have turned to worshiping foreign gods and speaking foreign tongues. Those who remain true to tradition are hardened by war and oppression, and are steadfast in their dedication to preserve their culture and protect their homeland."

 zarakens_group: "Zarakens Heritage"
 zarakens_group_desc: "The identity of the Zarakens was forged during a time of crisis for their people; religious conflicts were brought by the Prophets of the Zainudians and the Zarakens were one of the first groups to convert en masse, hoping to find a source of strength with the strange new heresy. Said to be lovers of money first and foremost - undoubtedly a slur against their willingness to fight for their faith - the Zarakens are Horselords, unbridled masters of heavy cavalry."

 phanician_group: "Phanician Heritage"
 phanician_group_desc: "After centuries foreign domination, first by the Zani then by the cruel Jarenam Empire, the Phanician traders took advantage of the death of Jarenam the Formidable to finally create independent states of their own. However, these two rump states are a pale imitation of what was once a great trading nation, whose colonies flourished even under Zani rule. Their naval traditions, outdated after centuries of decay, and the suffocating influence of the wealthy Phanician nobility have stifled innovation for centuries. Once rivaling even the Ular-Pria as the best sailors in Omniluxia, the ashamed Phanicians seek to reclaim their former glory after centuries of watching from the sidelines."

 esquelian_group: "Esquelians Heritage"
 esquelian_group_desc: "Related to the Phanicians and the Bhaxo-Kainaxari, the Esquelians were the original inhabitants of the plains of Bhaxnmrechtem and Kainaxarthos. With the arrival of the Zani under Zanis the Great, the Esquelians slowly began to mix with the incoming Geallian colonists, with those remaining true to their traditions retreating to more isolated and remote terrain. Natural merchants, their knack for learning foreign tongues and oratory skills made them highly sought after diplomats and administrators during Zani rule. Hiding in their forests and mountains, they are seen as too costly to fully subdue for the already unstable Jarenam Empire, and are hated by their Etaredican neighbors. Relying upon their diplomatic skills for survival in a tumultuous world, the Esquelians might yet hope to carve out a strong independent state for themselves."

 hazalars_group: "Hazalars Heritage"
 hazalars_group_desc: "The Hazalars are a savage group of nomads that have doubled down on their primitive way of life, killing all that have sought to bring civilization to their wild badlands. They are, without a doubt, the best riders in Luxterra, and their bands of horse archers have been known to destroy armies three or four times their size. Not even the Zani Empire, in their heyday, were able to tame the Hazalars, which remains a point of pride amongst their people."

 polarian_nations_group: "Polarian Heritage"
 polarian_nations_group_desc: "The Polarians, or Siauvis, are a hearty race of humans that live in some of the most inhospitable regions of Omniluxia, and the bitter cold and bone-chilling winds of their frozen isle never seems to bother them. The Polarians are master hunters and trackers, able to eke out survival in the harshest of terrains, and they excel at fighting in the snow-covered plains of their homeland. Descendants of the Northern Empire, they are the few survivors that fled north to the roof of the world to escape the calamity of the Great Collapse."

 snakefolk_group: "Ular-Pria Heritage"
 snakefolk_group_desc: "The inhabitants of the Austropetolian islands, known to many as the snakefolk but to themselves as the Ular-Pria, have been extremely isolated from civilization for thousands of years. No one knows how they became the way they are, but some historians suggest the snakefolk once inhabited all of Omniluxia long before the inception of the human race. Abandoned snake temples, the ominous remains of a time long past, can be found all over Omniluxia. No one has dared to disturb the snakefolk on their islands for centuries, as they are known to kill all who enter their lands with no remorse - not even the Zani Empire dared to impose themselves upon the snakefolk tribes. The only humans the snakefolk traditionally interact with are their fellow Austropetolians, who mostly reside on the north of the archipelago, and over many centuries of coexisting, there has developed a hybrid human-snakefolk society. For much of history, the snakefolk tribes have been heavily decentralized, but recently a great number of snakefolk have united under the name of the Euryalid Kingdom and are starting to send diplomatic missions to outsiders. To many, this is a cause for great concern, for the true intentions and nature of the snakefolk have always been shrouded in mystery..."

 austropetolian_group: "Austropetolian Heritage"
 austropetolian_group_desc: "Unwelcome in the human world and barely tolerated by serpentkind, the Austropetolians are the descendants of escaped slaves that found their freedom living on the abandoned islands of Triut. Austropetolians are natural sailors, taking to the water with an unnatural ease that make their serpent neighbours feel jealous, and their skill with boats has led many of their numbers to pursue a life of piracy on the Arteptolian Sea."

 eptelon_group: "Eptelonian Heritage"
 eptelon_group_desc: "The Eptelonian tribes live on the island that gives them their name, and for as long as anyone can remember, they have been fighting against the invading Horteonions for control of Eptelonia's jungles and mountains. Having long ago abandoned their migratory ways, the Eptelonians have built permanent settlements and homesteads for their people, but constant raiding from the Horteonians has made life difficult, and the appearance of High Elven colonists in the north has only complicated matters for the volatile region."

 horteonian_group: "Horteonian Heritage"
 horteonian_group_desc: "The Horteonians are a hearty race of humans that hail from the northern island of Horteon at the edge of the world; a cruel land, one that is bitter and cold like the tribes that were borne out of her frozen mountain wastelands. Hundreds of years ago, the Horteonians sailed from their harsh island and invaded Arteon and Eptelon, and although they were mighty conquerors that carved out many kingdoms, within a few generations, they abandoned their traditional Hortenic faith for the worship of the Wyrm-Slayer. Artheousan missionaries managed to successfully convert the Horteonians, and they have eagerly embraced the religion, spreading it through the lands they seized by fire and the sword."

 alaguric_group: "Alaguric Heritage"
 alaguric_group_desc: "The Alaguric tribes survive off of violence and rapine, selling their exceptional talents for plundering to local warlords and desperate Kings. When they are not enslaving their countless victims, a cruel skill in which they delight, they are racing their horses across the plains."
 
 flusenlander_group: "Flusenlander Heritage"
 flusenlander_group_desc: "The migratory tribes of the Flusenlanders live on the eastern coasts of Luxterra and are the most isolated people in all of Omniluxia. Some of the Flusenlanders live close to the Errnorfallians, but most have wandered deep into the forests and plains to places where they have no neighbors. Although they clearly crave solitude, they have also been known to migrate far from their homes without any warning, appearing thousands of miles away from where they last built their temporary settlements - their desire to be left alone could change at any time."
 
 selaskusian_group: "Selaskusian Heritage"
 selaskusian_group_desc: "A foreigner might not be able to distinguish a Selaskusian from any of the other nomadic tribes that wander the Skyreach Steppes, but this would be a fatal mistake to repeat, for it is said that the Selaskusian are more violent than their Duny or Alaguric cousins - a sobering thought, indeed. Selaskusian nomad hordes have been known to descend upon entire cities, enslaving tens of thousands at once, and it is for this reputation as civilization destroyers that they are feared by all."

 hobgoblin_group: "Hobgoblin Heritage"
 hobgoblin_group_desc: "Said to be the twisted children of dwarves and elves, or perhaps the cursed offspring of some dark and malevolent deity forgotten by man, Hobgoblins are a race of goblin-like creatures that are feared and despised by many, but misunderstood by all. Admittedly brutish in behavior and sometimes coming across as unpleasant in manner to those that they do not respect, Hobgoblins have thick yellow skin, reptilian eyes and are as tall as the average person, but are slightly stronger than their human counterparts. Although they are rumored to inhabit caves and other distant mountain valleys, they can mostly be found in the inner Dragon Pass, where they have ruled for as long as anyone can remember. Hobgoblin society is organized around a complex web of tribal blood oaths and ritualized religious observances, and there is a certain unspoken hierarchy in the village that is respected and acknowledged by all members of their community. They are exceedingly hostile to outsiders, killing all that enter their lands without their explicit permission, and perhaps with good reason - in the years past, many isolated Hobgoblin communities have been the victims of pogroms by outsiders, who have burned their villages and slaughtered their people without mercy and without provocation. Grimly determined to survive in a world that doesn't seem to have any room for them, the Hobgoblin cultures struggle against the dying of their light and are obsessed with preserving their way of life."

 drow_group: "Drow Heritage"
 drow_group_desc: "The Drow, also known as 'Dark Elves', are among the many ancient races of Omniluxia. Stories as old as time tell tales of the origin of these strange elves; it is said that at one point they looked and behaved just like the High Elves of Horteon. Records speak of a small contingency of High Elves who departed from Horteon for more fruitful lands and, after sailing for years, they finally settled deep in the mountains of Northeast Luxterra. Although these new lands were cold and harsh, the elves found that they had everything they needed. They lived in peace for many years to come until several great calamities befell them; first, earthquakes destroyed their homes and then a great pestilence came, which nearly killed all of the elves. With only a small group of elves remaining, the surrounding Northlander tribes descended upon them at night, slaughtering all who were not fortunate enough to escape. It is said that only fifty elves escaped that day; surrounded by enemies and with nowhere to go, they decided to flee deep into the intricate cave systems of the surrounding mountains.\n\nIn these caves there was no light, no people, and many thought there was no hope for the remaining survivors. After several days of trekking through the cave system, the elves found an underwater lake several thousand meters below ground, and with this they found hope,  as it contained fresh water, a strangely tasty species of cave fish, and hundreds of types of edible mushrooms. It was here that the small tribe of elves would live for thousands of years, trapped beneath the ground with no way out but enjoying at peace at last. Over time, the lack of sunlight and some strange elements of the mushrooms that they consumed transformed the elves into something entirely different from their original High Elf descendants...their eyes became black and their skin began to develop an otherworldly purple hue, and they began to worship the primordial forces of darkness. In a sunless land, they lived peacefully until the Great Collapse destroyed much of their underground habitat...but it also reopened the way out of the caves. Out of necessity, the Drow ascended back to the surface and once again established themselves along the outskirts of the mountains of Luxterra. The local inhabitants immediately vacated the area as they were terrified of their strange appearance. The Drow never let any of the locals close to them ever again, savagely killing all who entered their lands. In recent years, some of the Northlanders have begun to interact with the Drow and some have come to accept their religion as their own, spreading the reverence for the dark forces throughout Northeast Luxterra."

Zorg are unlike anything else on the planet; they have a strange, reddish hue to their skin and wide piercing eyes. Astonishingly, the DNA of every member of their species seems to be entirely identical, with no genetic variation whatsoever, leading some to speculate if they are even living beings..."

Devout even when facing extinction, Wielkopan's anger subsided and he took pity on his children, gifting them with the ability to settle and thrive in their new arctic home. Tucked away in their arctic cities, the gnomes are now threatened by new human and elven arrivals, who have pushed them back further into the ice over the centuries."

Hidden from Wielkopan's view, these gnomes thought themselves safe from his wrath, until their cockiness led to their discovery. Enraged, Wielkopan marked these gnomes with purple skin and reduced their existence to savagery, leaving their fate to Melodias, who further warped them into monsters that wreak havoc upon anyone who enters their domains."

aralans_heritage_desc: "When the Aralans were abandoned by the Zani, the various tribes had to learn to survive as strangers in a foreign land. Assualted by the aggressive Rohenoans as well as the incoming Zani-Vetalians, the various tribes were forced to coalesce under the strong hand of the Merovingi clan to survive. Carving a strong and independent kingdom in the south, the Aralans realm of the Merovingi is the strongest of the Aralans kingdoms, boasting a strong military and commercial connections with neighboring states. However, infighting amongst the selfish tribes has led to the breakup of what was once a united kingdom, and the hostile Bretagne Kingdom to the north poses a threat to the survival of the Aralans people."

jarenam_empire_heritage_desc: "Defeated by the powerful Soventeir Empire, the Jazari tribes were sent off to Bhaxnmrechtem, sold as slave-soldiers meant to tame the rebelling Etaredicans and Esquelians for the overextended Razani Empire. With the passing decades, their influence grew as the decadent Razani nobility in the region increasingly relied on their services until most government and military responsibilities were handled by Jazari slaves. Their luxurious lives came to an end when a young educated slave now known to us as Jarenam the Formidable Dragon led a revolt in the capital of the province, Zemmairthia, slaughtering the nobility and recruiting many experienced soldiers and ministers to his cause. After carving out an empire from the declining Razani, Jarenam died without an heir, allowing many of his conquests to slip out of the empire's control. After a brief succession crisis, the House of Totrazi was chosen to tame this unstable multi-ethnic empire, or face a complete collapse."

It is said that, like the two prophets of Zain'ud who bore the religion of Zainudian, the two peoples of Kaffira who bore the Kaffarian culture will storm the lands and unite all the true believers into one unified state.

However, after the fall of both their empires and the slaughter of their royal family, the Zaraken rump state that now exists is but a pale imitation of their former glory. Despised by all their neighbors and considered heretics by the Zainudian faithful for their association with Helluvian traders, the Zarakens of Kyaxares must rise again or face oblivion."

When the Zani Empire split and the Nazani Empire found themselves busy dealing with the Marshlanders, the Sovenerians saw their chance and conquered the Zanic colonists who lived in the fertile plains of Kainaxarthos. While initially only interested in taxing their subjects, the Sovenerians began to adopt Zanic culture under Uttarasmake the Great, who even adopted the Helluvian religion of his Kainaxari subjects. Declaring himself an Emperor in the Zanic style, the Sovenerians now seek to emulate the Zani, rejecting the cruel and ruthless ways of their Dragkhanic brothers.

The independent Malvanie colonies were once at risk of being overrun by natives, but their indomitable spirit allowed them to prevail. Although each of our far-flung colonies believed in a different philosophy, the Malavanes were able to convince the locals that their lives could be extended, should they listen to the Path of Life, and the natives could not resist. The Malavanes extended their lifespans but at the cost of being unable to reproduce. This enraged the natives, but, being no longer able to risk losing lives, they yielded to the Malavenes."

The incredulous King of Yeza would laugh at this tale, yet the priest insisted that his words were true and then challenged anyone to defeat him in a contest of poetry. It would be impossible for him to win, as he hardly could speak the native tongue, yet whenever stepped forward to challenge the priest, his opponent would choke on seemingly nothing and die.\n\nThe petty King of Yeza was taken aback at this supernatural display, and, deciding to test this goddess once more, commanded that the goddess' symbol, the Eye of Victory, be displayed upon the swords and shields of his soldiers. To his amazement, he managed to obtain victory after victory against forces two, three times greater than his own. He declared the goddess to be the patroness of the newly-founded kingdom."

Early converts to the Zanisite faith, they were granted special privileges that placed them in an ideal position to claim control of Baetep from the crumbling empires around them.

Their ancient realm of Baetep is said to have been founded a thousand years before even the Geallian Empire, but the armies of Zanis the Great destroyed their armies and sacked their capital, ending their rule. Forced to abandon the Imperial Palaces by the Tariku Pyramids, the Djedhid nobility fled southward to Usire Baetep, where they rule as Kings and Queens over a small remnant of their shattered Empire."

azar_dwarves_heritage: "Azar Heritage"
azar_dwarves_heritage_desc: "Like many of their other Golden Dwarf brothers, the Azar dwarves primarily reside in a single large centralized hold that hugs the great mountains of Luxterra. The mines and workshops in the Sacred Gold Caves of Tiuban have produced many of the most precious gold items in the world, and even during the days of the Zani Empire, the Emperors would make the long trek from the north to down to Tiuban to see the excellence of the Azar dwarves first hand. Now, this ancient capital is threatened in a way that it has not been for hundreds of years, with the rapidly-expanding Kaffira Kingdom pressing on their borders. Although there have been no direct conflicts between the two factions, tensions have been boiling for years and truly anything could happen..."

nofur_dwarves_heritage_desc: "The dwarves, known as Nofur for their distinct lack of hair, are new on the scene, having migrated from the central Luxterra mountains only a few decades ago into lands that many thought were entirely uninhabitable. It did not take them long to turn their new home into a dwarven paradise, known far and wide as one of the most desirable places for common dwarves to reside. In the last few years, the Nofur leader has become increasingly belligerent, for the increase in population, due to migration, has led to social unrest in the kingdom. As a result, the dwarves now have begun to look outward once again to expand their territory to accommodate their ever-growing population."

zani_heritage: "Zani Heritage"
zani_heritage_desc: "The Zani are the proud conquerors that threatened to subdue the entire world, brought down at the height of their power by the fatal mistakes made their Emperor. Although they had once splintered into two large groups, the Nazani and the Razani, there are still those that do not define themselves by notions of 'Western' or 'Eastern', but self-identify as pure Zani. It goes without saying that the unspoken dream of most Zani is the rebirth of their glorious Empire."

duny_heritage: "Duny Heritage"
duny_heritage_desc: "Long ago, the people of Duny, together with the rest of the Selaskusian people, united together in one of the largest rebellions in history against the great Zani Empire. Under the glorious Banner of the Duny, the oppressed steppe peoples were able to obtain momentary freedom from the Zani Emperors, but it was not long until the full wrath of the Zani would come down upon them, utterly destroying the alliance and returning them to slavery. This disaster occurred hundreds of years ago but now, after the Great Collapse, much of the Duny that were displaced and violently persecuted have recently declared their independence from the ailing Razani Empire. Will the Duny unite the Selaskusians to form a united front against the Zani dominance, or will they be crushed once again?"

Their government is run by the 'Sorrhlturr', which is further broken down into the noble-led 'Ghlattanvindr' and the citizen-run 'Arnnanvindr', with the Arnnanvindr electing a 'Hatamögg' to represent the nation on the international stage."

saptarum_heritage: "Heritage of the Ruined City"
saptarum_heritage_desc: "The Kingdom of Saptarum has never been the same after the sacking of their once prosperous city in 619 LC. Following their subjugation and subsequent independence, the Saptans drilled their soldiers rigorously to ensure such a humiliation would never again occur. However, with their royal line all but wiped out, powerful merchant families wrestled control of the nation from the Council of Elders that used to serve as custodians to the throne. During their subjugation and consequent infighting, the majority of the lands they used to own were overrun by Borderlander tribes, and Saptan domination over the region became a faint memory. However, their capital, Saptabi, still remains an important local trading hub with a strong warrior culture. With new empires loom over the horizon, will Saptarum see its history repeat or will it become an empire itself?"

qoes_dwarves_group_desc: "Qoes is the name of the small kingdom that was founded by the Copper Dwarf rogue and adventurer Edis the Grim, a bold and ruthless figure that turned a banishment from the Skyreach Passes into the opportunity of a lifetime.

Once a large number of these 'Isolated Ones', or 'Sênêkas' in their tongue, coalesced around their new homeland, their strange beliefs began to reflect the only constant in their lives, the Sun."

atheus_heritage: "Heritage of Atheus"
atheus_heritage_desc: "The many sons of the Atheus Domain descend from the Great Slaver Fleet that landed in Horteon centuries ago. These new colonists, led by their admiral Atheus the Conquerer, fought numerous wars against the native Horteonians and even the Gnomes, managing to expand their lands to encompass most of the south of the continent. Settling their new lands and even founding colonies in Arteon, the largest threat to the prosperity of the High Elves was the great High Elven Civil War, which split the realm between the more populous west and more urbanized east.\n\nThe High Elves of the great Atheus Domain are known as great warriors and mages, however their rigid social heirarchy has stifled any innovations or changes for centuries, and their reliance on human slaves to compensate for their lack of manpower has been one of their major weaknesses. Regardless, they remain the strongest power on Horteon, eager to once again expand their influence beyond the Land of Fire and Ice."

cymeva_heritage: "Cymevan Heritage"
cymeva_heritage_desc: "The Cymevans are the proud, urban, and highly xenophobic High Elves that supported Cymeva Atheus' claim to the throne of the High Elves. Most Elves live in the few cities along the Southern Coast of Horteon, afraid of the large amounts of Horteonian slaves and serfs that live in their rural northern holdings.

euryal_heritage: "Euryalean Heritage"
euryal_heritage_desc: "Stratified by their sense of piety and reverence to the so called 'Last Prophet', those subsumed peoples whose descendents went on to form the collective Euryalean culture were quick to accustom themselves to the draconic laws as is imposed by those reigning interpretors of Euryal's law. Unfortunately, this sense of devotion towards the latest Velkopic prophet does not extend beyond the core peoples of the league, and their harsh regulations have thus marginalized those outsider groups who have come under the governance of their Euryalean conquerors, forcing those able-bodied among the dissatisfied to turn towards a life of maritime anarchy in opposition of their legalistic overlords."

mignadg_heritage: "Mignadg Heritage"
mignadg_heritage_desc: "The descendent people of Old Mignadg, long ago the snakefolk of the northwest were unrivalled during a time before the rise of the imperium of Ular-Pria.

They are remembered most especially for being the birthplace of the four prophets Anandeix, Ishial, Saririyash, and Anegip, whose sisterhood went on to lead their sovereign's control as far as it did, their greatness is thus worshipped profoundly by evem outsiders."

But, in order to ensure our dominion lasts forevermore, we must begin cultivating an identity unique to our nation and it alone, thus solidifying our people's loyalty to the state. While this may limit the usefulness of our unintegrated countrymen, and it may even margianalize them within our society, we are certain that this policy shall further encourage them to begin adopting our practices until they are truly one with the nation, ready to take up arms and strive for our species' benefit against outside forces."
