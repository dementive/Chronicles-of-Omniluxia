 jarenam_empire_heritage: "Jarenam Heritage"
 jarenam_empire_heritage_desc: "The vengeful King of Dragons, the Jarenam Empire was forged by the fires of the Dunydurceg-Geallian wars. The Gaelli peoples displaced the Sovenarians, resulting in an exodus of the dragonkin from their homeland. After the fall of the great Zani Empire, however, one vengeful soldier, known as Jaren the Formidable Dragon, landed in the port of Zemmairthia and ravaged it, killing all the Gaelli settlers. From that day forth, the newfound Jareni state conquered all it could see, even reaching the lands of the Baetep in their merciless onslaught. However, Jaren died with no successors. Now, the Jarenam Empire stands as a multiethnic empire that is as unstable as the final days of the Zani Empire. Will the Jarenam vengence be cut short, or will the Draconic Empire stand to obliterate the Zani successor kingdoms?"

 kaffira_kingdom_heritage: "Kaffira Heritage"
 kaffira_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Kaffira Kingdom exists on the outskirts of civilization. Conquered by a Draconic people, the invaders quickly assimilated and adopted the local ways to survive the harsh desert environment. This new Kaffarian culture quickly became the greatest state within the realms of Zainudd. It is said that, like the two prophets of Zainudd who bore the religion of Zainuddian, the two peoples of Kaffira who bore the Kaffarian culture will storm the lands and unite all the true believers into one unified state. Only then will the divine be able to expand its horizons and conquer all those who worship heresies."

 zarakens_kingdom_heritage: "Heritage of Kyaxares"
 zarakens_kingdom_heritage_desc: "Of the many city states of Zakaria, Kyaxares proved to be the greatest of all. Over time, the league of Kyaxeres formed and a golden age proceeded. But then the prophets of Zainudd came and wreaked havoc upon the land. Despite this, Kyaxeres would foster a new home for one of the two prophets, and quickly established a new governance system around him. Although much of the golden foothills now belongs to bickering tribes, the Kyaxerid-led Zarakens, brandishing their new faith, are poised to reconquer the rich lands and fulfill the prophecies; to unite all the Zainudds together and then destroy the nonbelievers."

 soventeir_empire_heritage: "Soventeir Imperial Heritage"
 soventeir_empire_heritage_desc: "The vast, seemingly endless plains of the south are the heartlands of the Soventeir Empire. When the Zani Empire rose and invaded long ago, the Geallian people living on the plains were already well-established and were able to resist. In the aftermath of the Great Collapse, the governor of Soveneria agreed to rule over the Weageli in exchange for protecting them from the resentful Sovenerians, who desired their rich cities for themselves. With this powersharing agreement in place, the Empire quickly grew, and with the experience and help of Weagelians, the Soventeir were able to expand their borders, quickly surpassing all others and vastly extending their holdings. Although their Dragonkin brothers and cousins despise them, sometimes it is better to be one's friend than one's enemy."

 aralans_kingdom_heritage: "Aralans Kingdom Heritage"
 aralans_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Aralan people emerge from unknown origins, having conquered much of the peninsula at some point forgotten to history. However, their successions have become infamous for their carnage and savagery, and whenever one of their leaders dies, the land is wracked with civil wars that are brutal in character. While they once controlled all of their homelands, their power has fractured over time,no doubt due to their horrendous infighting, although it shows some signs of coalescing once more. The Aralans Kingdom remains strongest in the south, defending against the native Rohenoan tribes and the invading Weageli forces in Bretagne."

 lindum_heritage: "Lindum Heritage"
 lindum_heritage_desc: "The greatest of Nazani colonies, Lindum was established by Helluvian refugees fleeing the Zanisite religious majority in the Nazani Empire. The natives were friendly enough with the peaceful Helluvian colonists, however when resources became scarce, war became plentiful. The superior Nazani technology allowed Lindum to conquer large swathes of Vetalia, giving them security for the future - as well as ambitions to conquer even more."

 malavanes_heritage: "Malavanes Heritage"
 malavanes_heritage_desc: "The westernmost Elves in all of Omniluxia, the Malavenes lead the Malvanie League due to their prime position on the continent. Their capital, Shall'Shall'Ina, is a holy site for the Path of Life. The independent Malvanie colonies were once at risk of being overrun by natives, but their indomitable spirit allowed them to prevail. Although each of our far-flung colonies believed in a different philosophy, the Malavanes were able to convince the locals that their lives could be extended, should they listen to the Path of Life, and the natives could not resist. The Malavanes extended their lifespans but at the cost of being unable to reproduce. This enraged the natives, but, being no longer able to risk losing lives, they yielded to the Malavenes."

 myahudya_kingdom_heritage: "Myahudya Kingdom Heritage"
 myahudya_kingdom_heritage_desc: "The Myahudan Kingdom was once a loose confederation of barbarous tribes, but it is said that the Zornakyan Dynasty of the Yeza tribe received a visitor from far away Luxterra bearing grim news - it was a Gorzaari priest that was fleeing from the recent conquests of the Zani Empire over his people. He explained his goddess, the goddess of victory, watched over him and let him arrive in this blessed land, where he would meet a King and share with him divine symbols of strength. The incredulous King of the Yeza tribe would laugh at this tale, yet the priest insisted that his words were true and then challenged anyone to defeat him in a contest of poetry. It would be impossible for him to win, as he hardly could speak the native tongue, yet whenever stepped forward to challenge the priest, his opponent would choke on seemingly nothing and die. The petty King of Yeza was taken aback at this supernatural display, and, deciding to test this goddess once more, commanded that the solar symbol of the victory goddess be displayed upon the swords and shields of his soldiers. To his amazement, he managed to obtain victory after victory against forces two, three times greater than his own. He declared the goddess to be the patroness of the newly founded kingdom."

 zewggad_republic_heritage: "Zewggad Republic"
 zewggad_republic_heritage_desc: "The Zewggad Republic sits at the mouth of the Intermarenican Sea on the island of Marenica. Because of this, it has poetically been said that all boats eventually lead to Marenica, which is home to some of the greatest markets in the entire world. The Zewggad Republican system operates on wealth; money rules everything. The richest citizens naturally rule over everything, and this system has lead to the islanders having a reputation for being corrupt penny-pinchers and greed-obssessed fools, yet all acknowledge that their parsimonious ways have only helped the Zewggad prosper."

 razani_heritage: "The Razani Heritage"
 razani_heritage_desc: "The great Empire of the East, known to all as the Razani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of Unified Zani' or 'Empire of the United People.' The Razani Empire rose from the ashes of the Eastern half of the Zani Empire from the days of old. Unlike its counterpart to the west, the Razani Empire retains a 'purer' form of culture and often cites this as a tool of legitimacy against their rival-sibling to the west."

 nazani_heritage: "The Nazani Heritage"
 nazani_heritage_desc: "The great Empire of the West, known to all as the Nazani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of the Rebirthed Zani' or 'Empire of the People Reborn.' The Nazani Empire is a remnant of the Zani Empire from the days of old, but, unlike her counterpart in the east, the Razani, the Nazani people intermarried with the local peoples and created the new 'Weageli' culture."  

 gardowie_heritage: "Gardowie Heritage"
 gardowie_heritage_desc: "The Gardowie Clan were once the leaders of a large confederacy of Pomerian statelets. They managed to become the de facto leader of the others by capturing the fortress city of Wiaalda Garda in ancient times. The city has never been taken over since, and legends say that it took the powers of both Zerywan deities together to breach the walls. However, the ancient tribute-based system of the Gardowie Clan has fallen into disarray, and now it only holds its immediate neighbors within its sphere of influence. The fate of the fabled Unfallen City is perhaps soon to be called into question..."

 wielkolechowie_heritage: "Wielkolechowie Heritage"
 wielkolechowie_heritage_desc: "The mighty Wielkolechowie tribe rises from the ashes of the wartorn region of Lechia. Lechia was said, in myth, to be the birthplace of the Celestial Deer Jelenia. Because of the constant warfar, Jelenia left to Mount Malolech and graced the Zehian people instead.\n\nThe Wielkolechowie tribe derives its name from what others called them: the Noble Horsemen, Wielkolech. They stand in the prime position to unify the region of Lechia under one banner. And when the warring lords of Lechia unite, it is said that Jelenia will return and allow the uniters to conquer all they so wish to conquer."

 malolechowie_heritage: "Malolechowie Heritage"
 malolechowie_heritage_desc: "The people of the Celestial Deer reside in their great walled city of Starogrod. It is said that in ancient times, the town was under siege by invaders from the west when the Celestial Deer Jelenia came down from the mountain and saved the city. Regardless of the truth to this myth, Jelenegoory, or the 'Mountain of Jelenia', is indeed the saving grace of the people, providing the rare resource of soulgems and giving the local people wealth beyond their wildest dreams."

 sertem_heritage: "Sertem Heritage"
 sertem_heritage_desc: "The House of Sertem is the first local dynasty of Baetep since its conquest by the great Zani Empire in the olden days. The Sertem, during the long years of Zanite slavery, rose to prominence by being administrators and governors over the Imperial province of Baetep. They were early converts to the Zanisite religion, granting them special privileges and placing them in an ideal position to capitalize on the chaos after the unexpected fall of the Zani Empire."

 kingdom_of_dune_heritage: "Heritage of Dune"
 kingdom_of_dune_heritage_desc: "The Kingdom of Dune and its ruling Djedhid dynasty has stood strong as one of the longest-lasting noble houses in all of Omniluxia. The kingdom is said to have been founded a thousand years before even the Gellaius Empire. A great deal of precious metals can be found within their lands, and with this immense wealth, monuments honoring the esteemed rulers of their household have been built throughout the land. For hundreds of years, no one has dared to attack the kingdom as tales of their savagery in war are known throughout the land. However, the aggressive Sertep dynasty is building an army, seizing power, and multiple border skirmishes between the two rival kingdoms have recently taken place. Will Kingdom of Dune succumb to the boundless aggression of the upstart dynasts in Baetep, or will they continue to rule over the prosperous lands of Upper Baetep for thousands more years to come?"

 azar_dwarves_heritage: "Azar Heritage"
 azar_dwarves_heritage_desc: "Like many of their other Golden Dwarf brothers, the Azar dwarves primarily reside in a single large centralized hold that hugs the great mountains of Luxterra. Their territory of Rinekkud has produced many of the most precious gold items in the world, and even during the days of the Zani Empire, the Emperors would make the long trek from the north to down to Rinekkud to see the excellence of the Azar dwarves first hand. Now, Rinekkud is threatened in a way that it has not been for hundreds of years, with the rapidly-expanding Kaffira Kingdom pressing on their borders. Although there have been no direct conflicts between the two factions, tensions have been boiling for years and truly anything could happen..."

 nofur_dwarves_heritage: "Nofur Heritage"
 nofur_dwarves_heritage_desc: "The dwarves, known as Nofur for their distinct lack of hair, are new on the scene, having migrated from the central Luxterra mountains only a few decades ago into lands that many thought were entirely uninhabitable. It did not take them long to turn their new home into a dwarven paradise, known far and wide as one of the most desirable places for common dwarves to reside. In the last few years, the Nofur leader has become increasingly belligerent, for the increase in population, due to migration, has led to social unrest in the kingdom. As a result, the dwarves now have begun to look outward once again to expand their territory to accommodate their ever-growing population."

 duny_heritage: "Duny Heritage"
 duny_heritage_desc: "Long ago, the people of Duny, together with the rest of the Selaskusian people, united together in one of the largest rebellions in history against the great Zani Empire. Under the glorious Banner of the Duny, the opressed steppe peoples were able to obtain momentary freedom from the Zani Emperors, but it was not long until the full wrath of the Zani would come down upon them, utterly destroying the alliance and returning them to slavery. This disaster occurred hundreds of years ago but now, after the Great Collapse, much of the Duny that were displaced and violently persecuted have recently declared their independence from the ailing Razani Empire. Will the Duny unite the Selaskusians to form a united front against the Zani dominance, or will they be crushed once again?"

 rohenoan_group_desc: "The story of the Rohenoan people is one that is filled with countless wars, savage massacres and periods of enslavement, and over the years, this bloody history has created a culture that places a high value on military strength of arms. A well-equipped Rohenoan Knight, resplendent in head to toe in expensive gem-encrusted armor, is said to be one of the deadliest foes one could ever meet on the battlefield, for they are unrelenting in their assaults and fight with the ferocity of a people that bow their heads for no one. Bitter and laconic in temperament, the Rohenoan are known for their gallow's humor and their willingness to fight for honor."

 zani_vetalian_group: "Zani-Vetalian Heritage"
 zani_vetalian_group_desc: "Some Vetalians did not hide from the opportunities that the gods brought to their ancestors, choosing to show hospitality to the Zani colonists and ultimately changing the history of their nation forever. Over time, the sons and daughters of the two nations became as one, and these Zani-Vetalians soon drove their xenophobic cousins deep into the mountains, shattering their defensive leagues and taking the choicest lands for themselves."

 seeker_group: "Seeker Heritage"

Viewed as obsessive fundamentalists by many and described as joyless and intense, the Seekers have renounced their previous identities in order to fully embrace their religious ideals - a peculiarity that is viewed with suspicion by their neighboring communities."

The Drakhanic are known for their fairness, with the stranger having the same rights within their society as blood kinsmen."

 orcish_a_group_desc: "The Isle of Rendun at the heart of the Central Omniluxian Sea is the original homeland of all Orcish people, with those who live on the island maintaining a distinctive culture from the many others orcs that live scattered across the world. The three main Clans on Rendun - the Ioleic, the Longonesi and the Parati - have long struggled for supremacy against each other, with their many wars of aggression sending many displaced Orcish refugees and slaves to foreign shores."

 orcish_b_group: "Orcish Heritage"
