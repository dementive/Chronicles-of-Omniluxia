The #E Helluvian Heresy#! in particular has taken it's toll on the religious unity of the Empire, with once-loyal groups such as the #E Ytalians#! now questioning their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\nStill reeling from their near-destruction at the hands of #E Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!, the #E Razani#! under the aging [GetCharacter('(int32)12').GetName] now face internal forces that threaten to tear apart their crumbling empire. Due to his lack of a clear heir, uneasy whispers of an upcoming civil war pass through the residents of the #E Blue Marble Palace#!. On top of internal issues, the Empire must now defend their vast territories from both nomadic invaders as well as the various kingdoms and empires on their borders without the support of the wealthy Baetep province, lost to the cowardly #E House of Sertem#! during the #E Invasions of Jarenam#!.\n\nWith civil war and external invasions seemingly imminent, can the aging ruler of the #E Razani#! find a solution that could save the Empire of the 'True Geallians'?"

The last three hundred years of relatively stable rule has given the leading #E House of Nazani#! a reputation as more than just a cadet branch of the #E Zani Family#!, as they are known among their people as the #E Emperors of the West#! first and foremost.\n\nHowever, this stability and growth did not come without any losses. First giving up the #E Borderlands#! to native rebels in 697 LC and then Kainaxarthos to the [GetCountry('SOV').GetName] in 795 LC, many assumed that their hold on their continent would slip to younger empires like their eastern counterpart. Recognizing this threat, Emperor [GetCharacter('(int32)18').GetName] decided to act following the decisive loss of the #E Marshlands#! after centuries of stubborn native resistance. Focusing inwards, the Emperor developed his cities and farmlands, stabilizing the realm while filling his ranks with able-bodied men. Watching the success of his endeavors, the cautious Emperor decided to expand the #E Nazani#!'s influence through more subtle means rather than make rash offensive decisions.\n\nSecretly supporting the developing #R #E Orcish colonies#!#!, the #E Nazani#! have strategically been destabilizing and weakening the #E Borderlander#! and #E Celtican#! tribes. Should the cautious Emperor decide to decisively strike, they are sure to reconquer the divided #E Borderlands#!.\n\nWith relatively few enemies who can match their strength and a stable state loyal to its Emperor. The only threat to the Emperor's power are a number of small heretical #E Helluvian#! communities spreading across his nation like a plague. Despite this, the #E Nazani#! are in an enviable position, poised to become one of the #E #G Great Powers#!#! of #E Omniluxia#!."

If the Pharon does not act to unify the people of the #E Baetep#! under their foreign rule and faith, they might face the consequences of letting this hunger for liberty grow, held strong by the various independent kingdoms of the south."
