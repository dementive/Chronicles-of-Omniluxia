In contrast, the last sons of the #E #R Northern Empire#!#! are divided into various squabbling clans, their greatest hope being the #E Bear Hunters#! of [GetCountry('PS4').GetName]. In this critical moment in #E Polarian#! history, the fate of two peoples shall be decided once the first spark is lit."

 lorestart.17.desc: "While skirmishes between the #E Horteonians#! and the native #E Gnomes#! took place ever since the #E Horteonian Migrations#!, the #E Continent of Fire and Ice#! saw relative peace as the #E Horteonians#!, #E Eptelonians#!, and #E Arteonians#! traded between themselves and even with the #E Gnomish#! tribes.\n\nHowever, the landing of #E Atheus the Conquerer#!'s #E Great Slaver Fleet#! over two thousand years ago brought ruinous war to all those who lived in the #E Melodian Continents#!.\n\nThe various #E Atheusian-Horteonian#! wars saw the borders change, with the #E Horteonians#! suffering the same fate they inflicted onto the #E Gnomes#!, retreating futher into the hilly interior of the continent.\n\nDespite this tragedy, hope revealed itself to the various human tribes in the form of the #E Great Atheusian Civil War#!.\n\nSince the death of #E Atheus the Younger#! in 635 LC, his cousins [GetCharacter('(int32)33').GetName] and [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] split the empire, only briefly pausing to recover their manpower following the #E Great Collapse#! and the #E High Elven Peace#!.

 lorestart.20.desc: "The Golden Dwarves of [GetCountry('AKK').GetName] once ruled over an extensive empire, the #E Mahdad Sho-Tan'Maat Ma'Azari#!, controlling large portions of territory throughout #E Western Luxterra#! and ruling as tyrants. Their cruelty was their undoing, for they were betrayed by their kinsmen and destroyed by the Zani Empire. In an act of desecration that has never been forgotten, the armies of Zanis the Great destroyed the famed ziggurat #E Etemenazari#! at the heart of their capital [GetProvince('(int32)4262')GetName|E]; the heart of Azari civilization was methodically torn down, brick by brick, in a display of contempt and domination. A century of slavery passed before the Zani civil wars and the #E Great Collapse#!, and although the Azari rebuilt Tiuban and conquered the hinterlands of their capital, their hearts yearn for the glory days of the past."

 lorestart.23.desc: "Over the last few decades, the #E Wild Northlands#! of eastern #E Luxterra#! have seen Drow elves emerge from deep underground to conquer new kingdoms. These believers of the dark #E Blood-Stained#! faith savagely conquered the unsuspecting tribes living by the Norrfalian Sea with ease - the humans could not imagine that armies would appear from the mountain caves and never prepared for the possibility.\n\nOnce the wars of conquest drew to their bloody conclusions, the Drow established kingdoms close to the mountains, and in the following years, their influence and religious beliefs spread far beyond their current borders. Many humans fear the Drow elves, and alliances have been formed to keep them at bay."

Their services are in high demand as soldiers and mercenaries, for they are physically hearty and exceptional fighters, and they have become a familiar sight within the personal retinues of many Kings and Emperors throughout Omniluxia. The islands themselves have long been divided into small tribal chiefdoms, for no Orcanish warrior has been able to establish a hegemony over the many cities and settlements."

The peaceful Forest Elves desire nothing more than to walk undisturbed within their wooded realms, pray to Mother Cafea and tend to their forests, and for the most part, they are left alone by the other races living alongside them, who view their presence as an omen of good fortune."

And so tthe inhabitants of #E Werhen#! continue to squabble with each other, their potential strength diluted by greed and suspicion. Petty warlords rule over duchies as self-styled 'Kings' and an ever-shifting network of alliances and defensive leagues has ensured that no one country becomes too powerful.\n\nFacing hostile #E Intermarenicans#! and #E Geallians#! looking to expand their lands to their south and east as well as marauding #E Northlanders#! pillaging their villages, the #E Werherlanders#! have many challenges ahead of them, with the largest being the unification of their people."

The settled tribes of the Eptelonians were once peaceful, desiring nothing more than to live quietly in their villages and worship the traditional gods of their homeland undisturbed, but their recent circumstances have made the islanders suspicious of all outsiders.\n\nThere are many cities on Eptelon; some built by the local tribes, and many others have been constructed by the Arteonians and High Elves. The best farmlands on the isle are located near the coasts and have been taken over by the foreigners, who have forced the Eptelonians deep into the marshes and mountains of the interior."

Contact between the Elves and the mainlanders happens only by design, never by chance, for their ships are simply too fast to overtake.
