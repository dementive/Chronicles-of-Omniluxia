 lorestart.1.t: "The Razani Empire"
 lorestart.1.desc: "The #E Eastern Empire of the Zani#! born from the #E #R Great Split of 690 LC#!#! following the chaos of the #R #E Great Collapse#!#!, the #E Razani#! led by the #E Razani#! wing of the #E Zani Family#! lay claim to the legacy of [GetCharacter('(int32)48').GetName], holding his imperial capital of [GetProvince('(int32)2478').GetName].\n\nRuling over the 'True Geallians' from the #E Unconquered City#!, the #E Razani#!'s influence has waned in the past few centuries, losing many former imperial provinces to revolts or invasions. The #E Helluvian Heresy#! in particular has taken it's toll on the religious unity of the Empire, with once-loyal groups such as the #E Ytalians#! now questioning their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\nStill reeling from their near-destruction at the hands of #E Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!, the #E Razani#! under the aging [GetCharacter('(int32)12').GetName] now face internal forces that threaten to tear apart their crumbling empire. Due to his lack of a clear heir, uneasy whispers of an upcoming civil war pass through the residents of the #E Blue Marble Palace#!. On top of internal issues, the Empire must now defend their vast territories from both nomadic invaders as well as the various kingdoms and empires on their borders without the support of the wealthy Baetep province, lost to the cowardly #E House of Sertem#! during the #E Invasions of Jarenam#!.\n\nWith civil war and external invasions seemingly imminent, can the aging ruler of the #E Razani#! find a solution that could save the Empire of the 'True Geallians'?"

 lorestart.2.t: "The Nazani Empire"
 lorestart.2.desc: "The #E Western Empire of the Zani#!, one of the two states emerging from the #E #R Great Split of 690 LC#!#! which followed the #R #E Great Collapse#!#!, are led by the #E Weagelians#!, sons of #E Geallian#! invaders and the native peoples of #E Weagelia#!. The last three hundred years of relatively stable rule has given the leading #E House of Nazani#! a reputation as more than just a cadet branch of the #E Zani Family#!, as they are known among their people as the #E Emperors of the West#! first and foremost.\n\nHowever, this stability and growth did not come without any losses. First giving up the #E Borderlands#! to native rebels in 697 LC and then Kainaxarthos to the [GetCountry('SOV').GetName] in 795 LC, many assumed that their hold on their continent would slip to younger empires like their eastern counterpart. Recognizing this threat, Emperor [GetCharacter('(int32)18').GetName] decided to act following the decisive loss of the #E Marshlands#! after centuries of stubborn native resistance. Focusing inwards, the Emperor developed his cities and farmlands, stabilizing the realm while filling his ranks with able-bodied men. Watching the success of his endeavors, the cautious Emperor decided to expand the #E Nazani#!'s influence through more subtle means rather than make rash offensive decisions.\n\nSecretly supporting the developing #R #E Orcish colonies#!#!, the #E Nazani#! have strategically been destabilizing and weakening the #E Borderlander#! and #E Celtican#! tribes. Should the cautious Emperor decide to decisively strike, they are sure to reconquer the divided #E Borderlands#!.\n\nWith relatively few enemies who can match their strength and a stable state loyal to its Emperor. The only threat to the Emperor's power are a number of small heretical #E Helluvian#! communities spreading across his nation like a plague. Despite this, the #E Nazani#! are in an enviable position, poised to become one of the #E #G Great Powers#!#! of #E Omniluxia#!."

 lorestart.3.t: "The Kingdom of Baetep"
 lorestart.3.desc: "The #E Sertemic#! [GetCountry('EGY').GetName] has only recently seen it's freedom following the #E #R Conquests of Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!#! and his subsequent death. Tying themselves to a legacy much older than even the #E Geallians#!, the ruling #E Sertem Family#! are actually descended from Zanicized #E Phanicians#!, who used their guile and cunning to be appointed governors of the Imperial province of #E Baetep#!.\n\nWith the crumbling [GetCountry('EGA').GetName] losing their hold over their Empire, the #E House of Sertem#! under #E Tzondunnan Sertem#! managed to seize control of the #E Baetep#! in order to 'secure' it against invading #E #R Jarenamid#!#! hordes, claiming the province as the core of his new kingdom once he realized he could gain more power than he could ever have under the weakened [GetCountry('EGA').GetName].\n\nRuling a stable and wealthy realm, the #E Sertem Dynasty#! controls one of the strongest empires in #E Luxterra#!, and should they properly utilize its potential they could easily surpass or even conquer the ailing [GetCountry('EGA').GetName].\n\nHowever, while the #E Baetepians#! have grown used to #E Zanic#! rule, this small taste of freedom has lingered in their mouths. If the Pharon does not act to unify the people of the #E Baetep#! under their foreign rule and faith, they might face the consequences of letting this hunger for liberty grow, held strong by the various independent kingdoms of the south."

 lorestart.4.t: "The Soventeir Empire"
 lorestart.4.desc: "The Empire of #E Uttarasmake the Great#! started out as a group of Dragkhanic clans living under the shadow of the #E Celica Mountains#! centuries ago. Under the leadership of the #E Soveneria#! clan, hordes of #E Dragkhanic#! horsemen took advantage of the #E #R Second Marshlander Revolt#!#! to invade the wealthy #E #R Nazani#!#! province of #E Kainaxarthos#!.\n\n The following #E #R Nazani-Sovenerian War#!#! saw the #R [GetCountry('WGA').GetName]#! retreat from #E Southern Morrigon#! in 795 LC, allowing the victorious #E Soventeir Ulus#! to conquer most of their former territories. With no other rivals able to match their strength, the #E Sovenerians#! invaded the remaining #E Dragkhanic#! clans, controlling most of #E Southern Morrigon#! by 852 LC.\n\n In this environment, #E Uttarasmake the Great#! was declared #E Qhagan of Soveneria#! in 868 LC. Taught by #E Helluvian#! missionaries, the new Qhagan was a Zanophile who promoted the culture and traditions of the #E Geallian#! #E Kainaxari#! people in his borders. Seeking to further imitate the Zani, he declared himself #E #G Emperor of the [GetCountry('SOV').GetName]#!#! in 874 LC, as well as formally converting to #E Helluvianism#!. Claiming to be the legitimate heir of the #E Zani Empire#!, he spent the remainder of his reign spreading #E Helluvianism#! to his #E Dragkhanic#! kinsmen, replacing cruel and selfish #E Dragkhanic#! traditions with #E Helluvian#! or #E Geallian#! ones, and crushing all threats to his power, which included defeating and selling the hostile #E #R Jazari#!#! tribes to the [GetCountry('EGA').GetName] in 870 LC.\n\nHowever, the centuries have not been kind to the great #E Empire of the Zanic Dragkhans#!, as the years of prosperity and stability have allowed for corruption and complacency to seep into #E Sovenerian#! society.\n\nOften compared to the young ruler of the [GetCountry('WGA').GetName], [GetCharacter('(int32)16').GetName] was declared #E #G Emperor of the [GetCountry('SOV').GetName]#!#! in 999 LC. With the new milennia comes a new beginning, and he has vowed to banish corrupt officials and bring the empire to new heights.\n\nHowever, with corrupt officials endorsing his brother [GetCharacter('(int32)123').GetName] for the throne, unrest growing amongst their more traditionally #E Dragkhanic#! subjects, and rumors of a #E #R Hobgoblin Horde#!#! growing in the north, the young emperor has much work to be done."
