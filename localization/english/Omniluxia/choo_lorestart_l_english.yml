 lorestart.1.desc: "The #E Eastern Empire of the Zani#! born from the #E #R Great Split of 690 LC#!#! following the chaos of the #R #E Great Collapse#!#!, the #E Razani#! led by the #E Razani#! wing of the #E Zani Family#! lay claim to the legacy of [GetCharacter('(int32)48').GetName], holding his imperial capital of [GetProvince('(int32)2478').GetName].\n\nRuling over the 'True Geallians' from the #E Unconquered City#!, the #E Razani#!'s influence has waned in the past few centuries, losing many former imperial provinces to revolts or invasions. The #E Helluvian Heresy#! in particular has taken it's toll on the religious unity of the Empire, with once-loyal groups such as the #E Ytalians#! now questioning their loyalty to the Emperor.\n\nStill reeling from their near-destruction at the hands of #E Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!, the #E Razani#! under the aging [GetCharacter('(int32)12').GetName] now face internal forces that threaten to tear apart their crumbling empire. Due to his lack of a clear heir, uneasy whispers of an upcoming civil war pass through the residents of the #E Blue Marble Palace#!. On top of internal issues, the Empire must now defend their vast territories from both nomadic invaders as well as the various kingdoms and empires on their borders without the support of the wealthy Baetep province, lost to the cowardly #E House of Sertem#! during the #E Invasions of Jarenam#!.\n\nWith civil war and external invasions seemingly imminent, can the aging ruler of the #E Razani#! find a solution that could save the Empire of the 'True Geallians'?"
