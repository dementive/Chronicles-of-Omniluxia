#Missions 
####ARMY
03_duggmannrum_task_1: "Preparing for War"
03_duggmannrum_task_1_DESC: "Before King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can begin his conquests, he needs information on his opponents as well as time to consolidate his own armies. Spies are sent under the guise of diplomats to scout out the state of the other realms of the #E Green Valley#!. Meanwhile at home, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] begins to mobilize his forces."

03_duggmannrum_task_2: "Demand Subjugation "
03_duggmannrum_task_2_DESC: "Now fully prepared, the King sends out his messengers to every independent nation in the #E Green Valley#! besides the [GetCountry('SV1').GetName] to demand their subjugation. As they read the ultimatum, the leaders of the #E Green Valley#! have to decide whether to submit to this upstart King or defiantly stand against him."

03_duggmannrum_task_3: "Negotiate with the Order"
03_duggmannrum_task_3_DESC: "While our superior army is able to take on any other foe easily, the [GetCountry('SV1').GetName] is the exception. Rather than taking them on directly, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided that negotiating with the order is his best option."

03_duggmannrum_task_4: "Conquering the Brewers"
03_duggmannrum_task_4_DESC: "Starting our conquests in the east, we must subjugate the brewers of [GetCountry('SV6').GetName] if we have any hope of reaching the #G Eastern Gate#!. Their rich markets and flavorful beer will fuel our economy and our soldier's bellies."

03_duggmannrum_task_5: "Subjugating the Scholars"
03_duggmannrum_task_5_DESC: "The scholars of [GetCountry('SV5').GetName] will be a tricky opponent to face. However, our sovereign realizes the importance of innovation in this changing world, and their services and records will be needed for his future ambitions."

03_duggmannrum_task_6: "Crushing the Traitors"
03_duggmannrum_task_6_DESC: "The infamous Droi are now one of the last obstacles in our path. Ancient enemies of #E King Hefdarr 'to Togg'#!, they are hated by all in the #E Green Valley#!. Therefore, their conquest is necessary to eliminate all threats to our power, and will be a unifying feat for our new subjects to participate in."

03_duggmannrum_task_7: "Controlling the Eastern Gate"
03_duggmannrum_task_7_DESC: "To protect our exposed eastern flank against elvish marauders we must bring the #E Guardians of the Eastern Gate#! into our growing realm. Their important soul gem mine of [GetProvince('(int32)4075').GetName] might also be important to our nation's development."

03_duggmannrum_task_8: "Consolidating the Valley"
03_duggmannrum_task_8_DESC: "Our conquests have generated a lot of chaos and migrations, we should take this time to consolidate our hold over the #E Green Valley#! and secure our position."

####REFORMS

03_duggmannrum_task_9_DESC: "A scholar himself, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] hopes to learn from #E Hefdarr#!'s success during the #E Unification Wars#! and implement his policies. This includes enacting numerous meritocratic reforms that will ensure the loyalty and competency of his generals and administrators."

03_duggmannrum_task_10: "Integrating the Sennmöggen"
03_duggmannrum_task_10_DESC: "The #E Sennmöggen Knights#! are universally hailed as the best quality troops in the valley. Now that we have secured their loyalty we should choose whether to implement them into our armies as leaders or use them as elite guardsmen."

03_duggmannrum_task_11: "The Sennfernnen"
03_duggmannrum_task_11_DESC: "Long have we been using the antiquated #E Sennjallurr#! devised nearly 400 years ago by #E Hefdarr#! himself. While the formation isn't bad, it can be improved. Through his constant warring, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and his generals have had ample time to experiment with new tactics, which include the innovative #E Sennfernnen#!, a more modern variation of the ancient #E Sennjallurr#!."

03_duggmannrum_task_12: "Invite Foreign Mages"
03_duggmannrum_task_12_DESC: "While scant few mages have existed in our highlands and in [GetProvince('(int32)3988').GetName] for centuries, the widespread distrust of mages in silver dwarven culture has caused the mage community in our nation to be relatively small and underdeveloped. To help grow our small community of ragtag mages, the King has sent diplomats to the great schools of the #E Dragkhan#! to bring back mages willing to teach our young talent."

03_duggmannrum_task_13: "Expand Gerrbaen"
03_duggmannrum_task_13_DESC: "A powerful symbol of the King's authority, the #E Gerrbaen's#! capacity and scale have remained at the level of a small city. It is time to expand this wonder to be able to stand as a monument worthy of our great capital!"

03_duggmannrum_task_14: "The Sennkallen"
03_duggmannrum_task_14_DESC: "While our armies traditionally host only heavy infantry with some cavalry and archers as auxiliary, this creates significant weakness in our flanks. Therefore, the King and his officers come up with a solution: #E the Sennkallen#!. Regiments of heavily armored knights on heavily armored horses that can smash through both enemy cavalry and infantry."


#####DEVELOPMENT
03_duggmannrum_task_15: "Restore the Hthgart Brewery"
03_duggmannrum_task_15_DESC: "The once legendary #E Hthgart Brewery#! has spent nearly 100 years in decline, turning the once bustling markets of [GetProvince('(int32)3947').GetName] to shadow of its former self. It's time to honor #E Hlffstten#!'s legacy and rebuild his city and brewery."

03_duggmannrum_task_16: "Expand the Academies of Veddabi"
03_duggmannrum_task_16_DESC: "The academies and universities of [GetProvince('(int32)3988').GetName] have long served as the academic heart of the Anvindr. Now it is time to give them the proper funding they need to expand their operations and research."

03_duggmannrum_task_17_DESC: "The mines of [GetProvince('(int32)4075').GetName] could become a valuable asset if we are able to use their untapped potential. By expanding them, we can supply our nation with a steady supply of #E soul gems#! which would be useful to the magical researchers of [GetProvince('(int32)3988').GetName]."

03_duggmannrum_task_18: "Promote Urbanization"
03_duggmannrum_task_18_DESC: "Our people have historically been rural, with herders living in our mountains and serfs working on large estates in the few plots of arable land in our valley. The main inhabitants of our cities have always been the wealthy nobility and the few merchants wealthy enough to live alongside them. However, to compete with the large cities of the outside world we must provide incentives for peasants to come and make our cities more productive!"

03_duggmannrum_task_19: "A Land of Plenty"
03_duggmannrum_task_19_DESC: "The #E Green Valley#!, despite its name, actually has a scarce amount of arable land. With our growing population comes a growing demand for more food, a demand that we must satisfy lest we face famine. Therefore the King has devised a program of state-funded farms to provide the food that our people need."

03_duggmannrum_task_20: "Rebuilding Our Capital"
03_duggmannrum_task_20_DESC: "While [GetProvince('(int32)3883').GetName] has served well as the capital of a small kingdom, it no longer reflects the power that we now wield. To rebuild his capital into the seat of an kingdom worthy of being a successor to the #E Kingdom of Srrørum#!, King [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has enacted ambitious building programs plan in an attempt to make [GetProvince('(int32)3883').GetName] into a true #E Sørrborr#! of the silver dwarven world!"

03_duggmannrum_task_21: "Building a Grand Palace"
03_duggmannrum_task_21_DESC: "With the capital rebuilt into a true #E Sørrborr#!, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] plans to create a large palace to showcase his power to both his people and the outside world before he can declare himself the true #E 'Tögg'#! of the #E Green Valley#!."

03_duggmannrum_task_22: "The True King"
03_duggmannrum_task_22_DESC: "Now that he's unified, reformed, and strengthened his realm, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] plans to follow in the footsteps of #E Hefdarr#! and reveal his true ancestry, tying himself to a legacy that extends back to the #E Mythic Age#!!"
