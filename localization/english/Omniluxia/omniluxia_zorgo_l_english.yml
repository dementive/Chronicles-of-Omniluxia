 me_zorgoomni.30_title: "The Dissolved Lands"
 me_zorgoomni.30_desc: "We have discovered that there are sailors from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] that have defied common sense and have made some clandestine landings on the #E Dissolved Lands#! in the center of the #E Norrallani Sea#! in the hopes of finding plunder.\n\nAlthough there are dozens of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] folk tales and myths that describe the horrors awaiting those foolish enough to visit the cursed islands, some of our countrymen are unafraid of these 'grandmother's fables' and have explored the Dissolved Lands. There are reports of abandoned cities filled with unimagined wonders, and some of our explorers have found artifacts there that predate the #E Great Collapse#!.\n\nMany living within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have condemned these treasure seekers, claiming that they will bring untold calamities upon our people, and there is pressure for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to do something."
 me_zorgoomni.30.a: "As long as we get our cut of the treasure, I care not what they do"
 me_zorgoomni.30.b: "Any High Elves that land on the island shall be put to death"
 me_zorgoomni.30_tooltip: "The mission task '#Y The Dissolved Lands#!' has now been #G Completed#!!"
