A local priest claims that he has discovered an ancient book, one that predates the #E Great Collapse#!, with an indecipherable script written upon its yellowed pages, and has brought it to the capital in hopes that someone here will be able to translate.\n\nUnfortunately for all involved, none of our wisest minds were able to make heads or tails of the text, but that doesn't seem to matter; word has spread among the people that we have possession of a tome of great antiquity, which has only brought prestige and glory to the inhabitants of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."

The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people are mystified and take this to be a good omen."
