  me_zorgoomni.1_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], there is good news from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]! A local priest claims that he has discovered an ancient book, one that predates the #E Great Collapse#!, with an indecipherable script written upon its yellowed pages, and has brought it to the capital in hopes that someone here will be able to translate.\n\nUnfortunately for all involved, none of our wisest minds were able to make heads or tails of the book, but that doesn't seem to matter; word has spread among the people that we have possession of a tome of great antiquity, which has only brought prestige and glory to the inhabitants of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
  me_zorgoomni.1.a: "Uh, yes, right! We are collectors of antiquities and curious things"

  me_zorgoomni.2_desc: "A curious thing was seen this morning on the hills just overlooking [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], my [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle]. Before the sun had risen, purple crackles of light were said to be dancing through the fields - whether or not it was FaerieFolk or not, no one is certain, but echoes of laughter could be heard by those that witnessed these strange occurrences.\n\nThese creatures of light played for hours and vanished just as dawn began to color the skies. The [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people are mystified and take this to be a good omen."
  me_zorgoomni.2.a: "What could this mean, I wonder?"

  me_zorgoomni.3_desc: "My [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], there are reports coming into [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] that Goblin raiders have been seen near the borders, and there are even some that even claim that some villages in the hinterlands have been completely destroyed by this wandering horde of thousands. Panic is starting to spread throughout the capital and the price of grain is starting to go up; all in all, not the greatest situation."
  me_zorgoomni.3.a: "Curses! The gods must be angry with us"
  me_zorgoomni.3.b: "Send out warriors to investigate!"

  me_zorgoomni.4_desc: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], we are hearing frantic reports of a large #E Dragon#! that was seen flying a day's ride from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]. What is worse is that these are no mere rumors; we have dozens of eyewitness reports from our frightened soldiers, who abandoned their posts in order to share the grim news. No one knows which direction the fearsome beast has flown and everyone is terrified that the Dragon will appear at any minute."
  me_zorgoomni.4.a: "This is not good!"

  me_zorgoomni.5_desc: "This morning, a traveler dressed in tattered clothing appeared outside of the walls of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], asking for kind permission to be allowed entrance within our capital.\n\nWhen asked to state his name and business within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] lands, the man said that he had the great misfortune to be [SCOPE.sChar('tadm_traveler_scope').GetName], former #E Imperial Mage#! in the service of the [GetCountry('EGA').GetName], but that he had abandoned his post and fled his country after a failed love affair.\n\nWhen pressed by the guards to explaim himself further, Tadm wearily asked if we were willing to offer him refuge, claiming that he would be willing to part with his worldly possessions in order to find a place to rest."
  me_zorgoomni.5.a: "If the Razani Mage desires sanctuary, then he must pay for it"
  me_zorgoomni.5.b: "Give Tadm enough money to set himself up in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]"
