  desc_dragonscale_academy_mod: "Founded in 707 LC by fleeing Zani mages and local Zanicized Dragkhan mages, the Dragonscale School of Defensive magic specializes in the Zare Jad Style of magic. Their facilities are some of the best in Morrigon, and they host large libraries filled with centuries of magical records."
  
  first_academy_mod: "Magonis School of Summoning Magic"
  desc_first_academy_mod: "The first official Magic Academy, the Magonis School of Summoning magic was founded by Magonis the Wise in 518 LC during the Pax Zanica. Being the first of it's kind, the university set many precendents for the expectations of a Magical Academy, offering a space space for wizards to share knowledge without much external interference. However, negative attitudes towards magic users and magic in general in the past centuries has led the ruling Razani to stifle innovation and censor much of it's once groundbreaking work, sending the academy into decline.\n\nThe academy itself focuses on the Lubes Style, an Aldic form of magic in which Mages utilize mana to summon energy copies of creature they have encountered."
  
  gnome_projection_academy_mod: "Taanka School of Projection Magic"
  desc_gnome_projection_academy_mod: "Small in stature, the Gnomes stood little chance against the invading Polarians on any battlefield. Many 'Saamskoo' ran to the safety of the hostile north of the island, and when all seemed lost, it is said the Taalvut Åkoo revealed the secrets of Projection Magic to the 'Jemskoo' as a reward for their stubborn resistance. Building the academy in the great Hearth City of Åsgavskoo, the brightest gnomish mages now attempt to perfect their projection techniques to defeat the Polarian invaders.\n\nFounded in 704 LC, the academy focuses on the Taanka Style, an Omnic magic form that creates a large shell of hardened energy around the caster, granting them the strength and stature of giants."
  
  silver_tongue_academy_mod: "Psiddisamman School of Charm Magic"
  desc_silver_tongue_academy_mod: "Founded in 602 LC by the Phanician magician Oxynen, the Psiddisamman, or 'Magic Mouth' style first invented by Oxynen was refined and taught here. After various magicians trained in the style went on to cause mayhem in local governments, the Zanic Emperor Andenn restricted the students the university could teach, ensuring that none of them would cause any trouble or rally any armies against the state. With the anti-magic sentiments following the Great Collapse the Razani Empire further censored and restricted the university's teaching, with it now only seeing a brief period of new freedoms under the Gellazani Kingdom their mages helped create.\n\nThe academy teaches the Psiddisamman Style, an Aldic form of magic wherein the mage casts his mana through his speech in an attempt to make what he's communicating more appealing to the listener."

  mana_curse_academy_mod: "Palpan School of Curse Magic"
  desc_mana_curse_academy_mod: "During the height of magophobia in the Zanic world, a mage named O-Unn and his followers fled into the Dragon's Pass. Escaping death at the hands of the various Goblin and Hobgoblin tribes, the weary party settled down in the lands of the Shoishoni tribes, who agreed to protect them if they would teach their tribe magic. Thus, together with their new Shoishoni allies, O-Unn founded the Palpan Academy in 721 LC, teaching eager Hobgoblin students while also conducting his own research on the unique biology of his new allies. Through his studies of Melodias' Gift, he was able to eventually create a technique that would ensure the safety of the Shoishoni against their larger and more powerful enemies.\n\nThe academy teaches the Ponikar Style, a Melodian form of magic wherein the caster offers a small amount of their blood to Melodias to be able to temporarily drain their opponent's mana or even life-force."
