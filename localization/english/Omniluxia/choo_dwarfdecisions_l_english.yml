stone_heir_mod_desc: "Since the conception of our people we have argued over which of the three #E demi-god pairs#! are the true heirs of the great #E Stone Father#!.\n\nThe #E Silver Dwarves#! claim #E Htgarth#! and #E Ferja#! as the oldest pair are the clear chosen of our creator. The #E Gold Dwarves#! argue instead that the warlike #E Summsîr#! and #E Ava#! have claimed the title through their conquests of Luxterra. Finally, the #E Copper Dwarves#! press their claim that the crafty #E Frei#! and #E Dwadais#! managed to trick the eldest pair into giving up their birthright to them.\n\n Whatever the other groups may claim, by uniting the Dwarven world under our rule and owning the caves from whence our people emerged, we may be able to finally press our claim to the heritage of the great #E Stone Father#!!"

However his death centuries ago broke apart their great kingdom.\n\nTales have been spun about a new King who seeks to emulate this ancient hero, and only time will tell if he is successful.
