However, the ascendant #E House of Totrazi#! managed to consolidate their hold over the throne and the empire through guile, cunning, assasination, and brute force.\n\n However, now the head of the #E Totraz#!, [GetCharacter('(int32)29').GetName] presides over an empire of discontented subjects from the various cultures and religions present in his empire to scheming nobles planning to take his throne. Through his guidance alone the [GetCountry('JRE').GetRuler.GetName] shall either ascend once again, or crumble into pieces. \n"
