 revant_heritage_desc:0 "A race of wraith-like people that bring darkness and destruction everywhere they go. Having recently emerged from the legendary chasm that was once thought to be entirely dormant and utterly uninhabitable, left at the heart of the world by the Great Collapse, these people loyally follow their leader 'The Revant' to their death. Although some who have met them on the battlefield say that death is not something that wraiths experience, and they simply rise again if they are struck down in battle..."

 revant.3.t: "Arrival of The Revant"
 revant.3.desc: "A dark cloud has appeared over the #E Dissolved Lands#! that were considered by many to be entirely devoid of any life and impossible to live on due to the catastrophic effects of the #E Great Collapse#!.\n\nBy all accounts, the legendary chasm at the heart of the world seems to be bleeding darkness, and the skies above the island are choked by swirling clouds of unlight. Tales told by sailors passing through the area speak of endless hordes of wraith-like people who appear as nothing more than darkness to any unlucky enough to be close enough to see them. As word spreads throughout Omniluxia of the unfolding disaster, ancient tomes have been consulted all across the libraries and academies as sages and seers attempt to understand what is happening.\n\nThe oldest histories speak of a legendary hero known only as #E 'The Revant'#! who spent his life fighting against the dark forces of magic, but on the fateful day of the Great Collapse, he, along with his loyal army, was cast into the chasm that formed when the world was nearly split in two.\n\nBut legends say that the Revant did not die that day, and that when the light has left the world, he would arise from the deep darkness and wreak havoc on the people of Omniluxia. Most do not believe these fables, but it seems that the day of reckoning has come...The Revant has arrived and all we can do now is hope that our people can avoid the marauding hordes of darkness that have risen from the void."

 zorg.2.t: "The Zorg"
 zorg.2.desc: "Word has come from the far off province of [zorg_landing_site.GetNameWithNoTooltip|E] of the crash landing of a strange triangular prism-shaped flying object that has descended from the skies of Omniluxia. There are even many citizens in [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip] who have reported seeing the object flying by over head; some say it was miles across and could be seen passing for several minutes, even though it was falling through the sky at an extreme speed. The object seems to have been entirely destroyed on impact with the ground, but most horrifying is what seems to have emerged from the fallen object...alien beings, clearly not from this planet.\n\nThose who were unlucky enough to be there at the first encounter claim that they called themselves #E 'Zorg'#!. The Zorg are unlike anything Omniluxia has ever seen; they have a strange red hue to their skin, wide penetrating eyes, and somehow every member of their species seems to have precisely the same genetics, with no variation in their population whatsoever. Their strange appearance, and the fact that they are all the same, has led many to question if they are even living beings at all or if they are...something else.\n\nOnly time will tell what intentions the Zorg have and why they have arrived in Omniluxia...although it does not seem good, as they have taken over the province of [zorg_landing_site.GetArea.GetNameWithNoTooltip] in the short time after they crash landed. Some in the area have even reported seeing their friends and family become one of the Zorg when they came into contact - everything about their old selves was immediately erased and they adopted precisely the same attributes of the rest of the species...\n\nLet us hope that these are merely outlandish tales and nothing more, for if the Zorg we have been told about were to arrive on the borders of [SCOPE.GetRootScope.GetCountry.GetNameWithNoTooltip], there seems to be little we could do but hope they come in peace."

However, these reports indicate that there is a possibility that someone or something has managed to unite them all. The implications of this alone are terrifying, and it is best to prepare for the inevitable invasion coming soon!"
