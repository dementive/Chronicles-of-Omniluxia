 zani_philosophydesc:2 "The Zani Traditions represent the focus on heavily armored and disciplined infantry found in the Eagelia, Zanis and other Eagelian states. They came to favor the sword over the spear, and relied on quickly closing ground with and dispersing less well equipped infantry using strict formations, such as the Triplex Acies, with supporting light cavalry and skirmishers.\n\nFort Defense: #G +25.00%#!.\nCan unlock the '#Y Raid City#!'

 zani_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "The Walled City"
 zani_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "Heavily fortified cities dotted the landscape of the Eagelia for generations.

Even tribal cultures possessed a mixture of potent bronze and iron equipment, rendering them a fearsome sight to behold."
 zani_tribal_path_2:0 "The Horseman Order"
 zani_tribal_path_2_desc:0 "In Zani, the horseman constituted an entire sub-class of lords; wealthy aristocracy whose holdings indicated their prestige. As such, the superior wealth and training of the horseman afforded them the liability to serve in the exclusive cavalry contingent of the republic's forces. Elsewhere in the Zani world, warhorses were regarded as the domain of the elite, the horses themselves often being laid to rest alongside their earthly masters in the event of their death."
 zani_tribal_path_3:1 "The First Emperor Devotion"
 zani_tribal_path_3_desc:0 "Relying on the devoutness of their own soldiers, and that of their opponents, the Eagelian rival forces are reputed to have used their priestly orders to curse their foes in plain sight, causing them to rout. In any event, the peoples of ancient Zani left nothing to chance; proper obeisance was made to the First Emperor and the gods, before each battle was made."

 zani_tribal_path_6:0 "The Zani Fleet"
 zani_tribal_path_6_desc:0 "The coast played a huge part in the economic life of Eagelia.

 zani_tribal_path_7:0 "Rousing Oratory"
 zani_tribal_path_7_desc:0 "The popularity of the Intermarenican model of democracy spearheaded the empowerment of populist sentiment throughout a land hungry for rights. A skilled orator could sway entire cities in support of his or her cause, which could, at times, be useful."

 zani_support_path_5:0 "Logistics of State"
 zani_support_path_5_desc:0 "As the Zani military expanded, the practice of each soldier providing his own weapons became unsustainable. Thus, by instituting a chain of supply, from natural resources, to blacksmith, to the hands of her soldiers, The Zanis fueled her war machine with ease."
 zani_support_path_6:0 "Shield Walls"
 zani_support_path_6_desc:0 "Adopting the iconic shield, the Zani shields, alongside the development of the manipular system, gave the Zanis a decisive advantage over her local enemies. Subsequently, the scutum became almost a national icon for the Zanis; the very presence of a Zani shield wall was often enough to win a battle before it started."
 zani_support_path_7:0 "Foederati"
 zani_support_path_7_desc:0 "Zani's primary source of cavalry in the mid-Imperial age, had shifted from the horseman order to mercenaries and allied states. This allowed a diverse array of styles and abilities to be incorporated into the ever-growing Zani military."

This method enabled them to pacify a large number of territories, by establishing a permanent dwarf presence and defending the natives and itinerant traders from any bandits. The Dwarves were then seen as the legitimate rulers of these colonised lands."
 larsa_dwarf_path_5: "Strong Arrows"
 larsa_dwarf_path_5_desc: "Despite their resilience, Dwarves have recognised the difference in size between themselves and the others races of the world, which puts them at an obvious disadvantage in melee combat.

The great families each had their own prestigious armies that competed with each other to show the greatest feats of arms on the battlefield. It was not uncommon for ambitious young noble to emerge from these forces and rise through the ranks to take command of the army itself."

 zarakens_zagartian_path_1_desc:0 "From those ancient times, having after descended from the eastern mountains of Zagarti and Uuxii mythology, the twin peoples of eastern Zarakia have always kept to themselves their ancestral, and highly exceptional, methods of horse breeding. Possessed of astute know-how in assessing any sort of equine, a typical breeder understands which colts are to be culled, and which ones are meant to rear in the next generation of Zaraken war mounts. Bred for their durability and speed, Zaraken stallions are renowned all across southern Omniluxia, the prestige that comes from owning even one of these fine creatures being enough to ignite wars among the sedentary folk. Though their fame as beloved war steeds exceeds them far enough as to reach capity city of the Zanites, the nomads of Zarakia also utilize their bestial companions with matters such as transportation and logistics."
 zarakens_zagartian_path_2:0 "Spirit Of The Ancestors"
 zarakens_zagartian_path_2_desc:0 "The nomadic Zarakens of old were a people who had been continously vilified and chased away by foreign adversaries, forced into exile on multiple occassions before they had finally breached the dwarven holds of the Anempanso. It was here did the ancestors of the Zarakens become mixed with the blood of their dwarven subjects, whose beliefs they partook in readily. As such, the Zarakens were quick to adopt the practice of ancestor worship, a custom they have kept close to their hearts even after their expulsion from the eastern mountains. Within their new homeland they have taken with them the memory of their ancestors both human and dwarven, determined to keep their lands for themselves in order to honour the hardships of their forebears. This is a sentiment felt most hotly within the context of war, for it is on the battlefield do the Zarakens have everything to lose, including their homes."

But such an assumption couldn't be farther from the reality of their traditional methods of warfare. Though they do not typically employ formations as how other cultures may view it, the military order of the Zarakens do indeed possess a heirarchy, one which cannot easily be broken. Composed into decimals of ten, a typical unit of Zaraken warriors is called a Zomend, and its constituent men are thus put through intense training routines in order to foser both comradery between its individual members but as welly loyalty towards their respective war captain."

Not only that, it as well offers better stability, giving respective riders a foundation by which they can both hoist themselves upon their steeds, and to manage their form as to not fall over during combative circumstances."

While there do exist cases of plain nepotism in terms of assigning certain aristocracts to such a position, members of the Ashand are generally competent and well trained in the art of not just warfare, but as well as being able to serve in leadership roles sufficiently and without falter. Candidates for the Ashand often come with both their equipment in tow and as well as fertile mares, bronze ingots, slaves, and a herd of sheep, with it being customary for aspiring warriors to bring with them evidence of their family's richness and prestige."
 zarakens_zagartian_path_6:0 "The Sabanshir"
 zarakens_zagartian_path_6_desc:0 "The Sabandshir are in large part composed of servants, slaves, kinsmen, and foreign auxiliaries. They largely play a supplementary role in organizing an army, being in charge of things such as the maintenance of equipment, the cooking and storage of food munitions, and as well as the care required in order to keep the armie's mounts in well condition. Often times when a war has been concluded, an army's constituent members become no different from their prior clans that they had grown up in, and will decide in favor of not disbanding the regiment as a whole, forming a new household composed of all the roles it needed filled. This allows for great mobility and demographic change among the nomadic Zarakens, always ensuring that men and women from differing households will always get the chance to find one another and form a married pair in order to prevent possible inbreeding amongst kinfolk."

The width of these new holdings are marked by the looming kalmirsh statues, each one crafted in the likeness of their households' respective ancestors. It in these territories do ordinary kinsmen sustain themselves through a mixed lifestyle of both sedentary and nomadic pastoralism, with settlements having popped up due to the availability of easily exploitable resources such as ores and wild game. As such, many of the more permanent residence of the atypically nomadic eastern Zarakens tend to be economicaly on par with those shanty villages of neighboring cultures, displaying sizeable wooden structures and as well as impressive smithies that can sufficiently arm the local warriors."

 zarakens_imperial_path_1:0 "The Legacy Of Eszarakayn Shazum"
 zarakens_imperial_path_1_desc:0 "The founding father of the modern Zaraken peoples, a uniter of the sedentary and nomadic polities of his age. Born a noble son to the Zinduidian house of Shazum, his family were the stewards of Kyaxares for generations, lording over the people both fairly and with stern protection for them. The idyllic paradigm of their rule was overturned, however, for the nomadic Uxiians and Zagartians came flooding in from the east, the half-dwarven menace proving far too barbarous to defeat plainly in battle. Even Eszarakayn himself was the victim of one their many punitive raids, whisked away as a captive when he and his brothers were exiled after their uncle siezed the kingship through a palace coup. Among the Zagartian clan of Umbushmir did he linger, the time he spent there thus garnering for the young aristocract a sense of respect towards his captors, for despite the circumstances of his stay, the nomads treated him, his brothers, and their assorted entourage with respect and courtesy. He learnt much of their ways, their beliefs, and even language, but most importantly did he understand the means to their martial superiority. In their mighty steeds did he find both his salvation and vengeance, for with a stout cunning he concinved their chiefs to lend to him their hordes in a war against his despicable uncle, and in exchange he would devise for them territories by which they would govern for themselves as kings equal to himself. The chiefs, skeptical at first, demanded he would swear a blood pact with them, claiming that they would keep his brothers until the end of Eszrakayn's reconquest, and so they were exchanged for their cooperation and arms, thus laying the foundations for the Zarakens' rise to imperial authority."
 zarakens_imperial_path_2:0 "The Kaxham Guards"
 zarakens_imperial_path_2_desc:0 "Descended of the Uuxii clan of Kaax and the Zinduidian household of Ehwam, the Kaxham guard is a highly pretigous and hereditary role as seen within most Zaraken polities. Born from the unification of the sedentary and nomadic peoples by Eszarakayn the Shazumid, the first and foremost iteration of this acclaimed order formed as a collection of his most loyal companions, of which signed with each other an oath through the spilling of their blood and the declaration that they shall have no allegience other than to Eszarakayn. In the following years of their liege's mighty conquests, each one of them were rewarded with a parcel of land for them to maintain and govern during the Shazumid administration of the Zaraken Empire. Though their oaths wavered in the later generations, their children, and then their own children with so on and so forth, all upheld the martial lifestyle of their glorious ancestors, acting more as private mercenaries to whoever occupied their land rather than to the true Shazumid bloodline."
 zarakens_imperial_path_3:0 "The Divine Crescent And All Her Gifts"
 zarakens_imperial_path_3_desc:0 "Ancient and myserious, filled to the brim with grand beauties such as singing estuaries and liminal beasts, the so called 'Divine Crescent' had always fed its children, washed them clean when they have been made impure, and saved them whenever foreigners sought to impose their will upon land not meant for their ilk. It is the sire to the 'Brotherly Mountains' that safeguard the locals from invaders to the north, and inbetween their ranges and the coasts runs their river children who breathe life into the sun dried soils. As for the 'Mother Gulf', it is said that the she taught the people surrounding her the secrets to ship making, how to know the winds blow favorably in their direction, and to discern good waves from the bad. Even after those shifting times when the native Zinduidians united with the nomads and took up the name of Zaraken, the worldly spirits still looked upon their changed wards favorably and without contempt, continuing to let pass the natural obstacles so that they may prosper forever. As such, the Zarakens have since grown only stronger in their maritime traditions, able to buid vessels that may rival the galleys of the Zani States."
 zarakens_imperial_path_4:0 "Urban Levies"
 zarakens_imperial_path_4_desc:0 "During the ancient days of Zinduidian prominence within Zarakia, it was often uncommon for the residents of any city to actually take part in the act of warfare other than to staff those hierarchial positions of captains and generals. Having relied on the rural folk to do their wars, conflict within the 'Divine Crescent' was often lackluster and sparse, and even highly ritualized in certain regions where the goal was not to kill your opponents, but to simply best them in personal duels. This all changed with the emergence of the Zagartii and Uuxii hordes, led under the sage leadership of Eszarakayn the Shazumid, bringing across the land a sense of martial fevor in the following generations as the bellicose values of the nomads began intermingling with Eszarakayn's sedentary mindset. The governance of city populations thus drastically changed, with it becoming mandatory under Shazumid rule that all men above the age of eighteen be forced to serve at least two years in militant service, this greatly enhancing the military capabilities the Zaraken Empire. Though their reign has since come to pass, this law stuck itself within the legal codes of most cities, showcasing the extent to which Shazumid rule breached into the normalities of the urban worlds of Zarakia"
 zarakens_imperial_path_5:0 "Shazumid Regality"
 zarakens_imperial_path_5_desc:0 "Most aristocratic families who preside within Zarakia can, one way or another, trace their ancestral lineage back to the house of Shazum, whether by direct descent from Eszarakayn or through one of his many brothers. This allows the noble families to presume lordship over the massess, citing their pretisgious bloodline as evidence of their mandate to govern. While this order may often find itself opposed or even undone in certain cases, this general rule of thumb has allowed there to flourish a sense of peace ever since the fall of the Zaraken Empire, for gone are the days of constant uprising and revolt, for even the spirit of the land itself can only bear to hold upon it the reign of descendent of the Shazum."
 zarakens_imperial_path_6:0 "Bastardized Dwarven Metal"
 zarakens_imperial_path_6_desc:0 "Though the Uxii and Zagartii can trace their lineage back to those scarce moments of intermingling between man and dwarf, and in turn remain inclined to keep up the spiritual practices of their dwarven ancestors, in terms of material culture they are anything but dwarven. Though their many smithing techniques may take cues from Copper Dwarf skill, their products remain that of the ancient humans who make up the rest of their heritage. Their traditions are then further translated into a Zinduidian lens, who as well picked many of their smelting techniques from the neighboring Golden Dwarves. This in turn has led to the creation of an alloy that, while weaker than the typical dwarven product, is often stronger than those produced by neighboring human cultures. A competent smith is able to refine this metal into a sharpened edge that can pierce any material, so much so that it can rival the obsidian blades of the Karksm. As such, it is mostly used for in the creation of arrow and spear tips used by the common horse archer and infantry line."
 zarakens_imperial_path_7:0 "The Kaxhamid Knights"
 zarakens_imperial_path_7_desc:0 "Born out of union between the nomadic clan of the Kaxii and the urbanite household of Ewham, Kaxhamid Knights are an order of prestigious warriors sworn to uphold the reign of all Shazumid descendents. Initially, they were composed solely of Eszarakayn's most loyal companions both Zinduindian and Zagartian, then made to swear both themselves and their descendents to the Shazumid bloodline whilst wavering all former vows of allegience. Thus, the modern sects of the Kaxhamids are composed of people directly descended from those great brothers in arms to the first Shahanshah, and uphold dutifully their oaths in subservience to whichever branch of the Shazumid dynasty has come to occupy their respective lands."

 zarakens_katssaspion_path_1:0 "Kossian Horse Javelineers"
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_1_desc:0 "The warriors of western Zarakia typially draw their martial traditions from the lightweight and grounded, possessed of cloth amd leather bound soldiers armed with short swords and spears. But following their integration with their eastern neighbors, it became impossible for them not to fall under the influence of their nomadic kinsmen. Through years of extensive trade and communal intermingling, most horse herds in western Zarakia can one way or another draw their lineage from mounts of the Zagartii and Uuxii, and have since evolved due to both new genetic stock and as well as selective breeding imposed by their sedentary masters. While smaller and less fast, Kossian horsemen are bulky and thus extremely durable and stalwart in the heat of battle, able to allow their spear-throwing riders to get close enough as to deliver a piercing blow."
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_2:0 "Parsa Ethos"
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_2_desc:0 "Making up a large part of any auxiliary within the typical Zaraken army, the Parsa often take up roles such as camp defenders and scouts, sought out for their undying spirit and ability to take on enemy forces larger than their own. They were among some of the deadliest peoples who had been brought under Shazumid reign, regarded by their contemperary foes as a brave and yet primitive people, relegated to footnotes among earlier sources as nothing more than a group of coastal barbarians. When Eszarakayn brought them into the fold of his empire, he elevated them from their lowly lifestyle, thought them how to build cities, and especially how to use their martial prowess most effectively, making them some of the most valued of warriors in all of Zarakia." 
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_3:0 "The Guarded Hill Formation"
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_3_desc:0 "Designed under Hiszorumin Ahakla, one of Eszarakayn's Zinduindian generals of whom he is rumored to have bedded during their campaign together, the Guarded Hill Formation emphasizes cohesion and swift movement. Composed of heavy armored troops and camel mounted skirmishers, the camelry are meant to draw in enemy forces with a round of intense firing, only to retreat back behind the lines of scaled metal that were their comrades in arms. With coordinated movements, these regiments would let way for their compatriots as they hastily sped back behind their defensive wall, quick to charge forth afterwards as they gave the enemy no chance of escape. Bogged down by unyielding forces, those armies who opposed the Zaraken encroach were to quick to find themselves utterly destroyed once camelry had charged them from behind, having flanked them as their allies kept them pinned."
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_4:0 "The People Of Forts"
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_4_desc:0 "The land of Zarakia has, from the dawn of its inception, proven itself to be a place lackluster in natural defenses barring the nigh-impassible mountains that seperate it from northern Luxterra. As such, prior to their joining with the Zagartii and Uxii, the local Zinduindian peoples, surrounded by their abundant estuary systes that allowed for a reliable source of mud, became expert brick makers and thus built upon the edges of their ancient homes the impressive walls that protected them against the local beasts and enemy states. Even amongst the more quaint village communities such as farming or mining settlements, there exists a barrier from the outside world that has faithfully protected its makers. This penchant for communal planning has engendered there to be military tactics that keep such civics in mind, creating an arms race in which builders become more proficient in their craft, and generals become more inclined to compose better siege strategies."
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_5:0 "Kaffira Camelry"
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_5_desc:0 "The return of the Dunyducreg from the southern shores of Weaglia have sparked an era of cultural and material influx between the native peoples of Luxterra and their western neighbors. With the foreign invasion of the qhans there came with them a plethora of military ethos and tactics that then further enriched the locals, chief among them was there import of camels, of which they had whisked away from the lands of Baetep with punitive destruction in their wake. With these beasts by their sides, the one sedentary invaders once more took up the nomadic lifestyle of their anceitn forebears before the Great Collapse of Omniluxia, spreading far and wide as both merchants and marauders. To the lands of the Zarakens, they became warrions of the coin, making up a good deal of the auxiliary contingents of the local militaries."
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_6:0 "Those Days Of Reckoning"
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_6_desc:0 "Anyone who is well sufficiently educated enough in the history of Zarakia can tell that the Zarakens' rise to imperial statehood happened just as fast as their unfortunate downfall. No one force can be pointed towards as the perpetrator behind their demise, with many sources citing western piracy as being a substantial factor in disrupting the local economy and as well pillaging those coastal settlements, whilst on the other hand there are recorded instances detailing the political intrigue that surrounded the reigning branch of the Shazumid dynasty, whose fellow cadet houses were all but too eager to plot for their doom. Most importantly however, was the arrival of even more nomads from the south, the Alagurs and the Selaskusians, whose presence took up a good portion of the military's time. It matters little to most, as the results were all the same, as the realm became weakened enough as to allow those Dunyducreg invaders from Weaglia to sweep in against the native forces and effectively crush them in battle wherever they went. Though the draghkan qhans never went so far as to genuinely conquer all of Zarakia, they createed an event chain that eventually sparked into numerous aristocratic uprisings, as well as giving the eastern nomads an opportunity to gain even more groun. This period in Zaraken history is called 'Those Days Of Reckoning', and is thus taught to all aspiring generals of the Zaraken nobility as lesson against the fracticious politics that swept the old kingdom."
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_7:0 "Qovra's One Thousand"
 zarakens_katssaspion_path_7_desc:0 "The namesake to the province of Qovra, the 'One Thousand' are a group of independent militia men and vigilantes who are said to have holdings all across Zarakia. What was once an order of policing crusaders founded under the command of Eszarakayn II, they eventually cut all ties with the central government following the empire's collapse as it began evermore riddled with political unrest sourced from the numerous branches of the Shazumid bloodline. Since then, they have acted as heroes for the meek and oppressed, choosing to serve as a counteroffensive whenever any one group of nobles once again chooses to step out of line against the interests of the common people. While their efforts may not often succeed, they are beloved by people far and wide for their mission to safeguard the wellbeing of the people. This, however, has led to an unstable relationship between them and their contemporary opposities, that being the reining elite of Zarakia. This relationship can often range from downright hostile to mildly opposed to one another, but when any force of forein origin seeks to raze once more the cities and pastures of the land, these two forces prove more than willing to lend each other a hand in defense of the homeland."

zani_seeker_philosophy:0 "Seeker Traditions"
zani_seeker_philosophydesc:0 ""

seekers_reaserchers_path_1:0 "Arbalist Academies"
seekers_reaserchers_path_1_desc:0 "The Arbalist is the favored weapon of Seeker crossbowmen, due to its strong piercing power, and far range. However, one downside is that it is slower to fire and reload than the bow."
seekers_reaserchers_path_2:0 "Well-Regulated Levies"
seekers_reaserchers_path_2_desc:0 "Seeker levies are no common peasant rabble- their enlisted soldiers train a minimum of 3 months before serving in combat. A small reserve of permanent knights, and reserve soldiers allows the Seekers to always have some well experienced soldiers in their army."
seekers_reaserchers_path_3:0 "Military Engineers"
seekers_reaserchers_path_3_desc:0 "Much to the chagrin of enemy nations, Seekers are masters in siegecraft. It is said that Seeker siege engineers could topple the walls of Camaelot in a mere month, given enough men, of course."
seekers_reaserchers_path_4:0 "Elite Legions"
seekers_reaserchers_path_4_desc:0 "Seeker Legions train not just the sword arm, but also the mind. In addition to their rigourous martial training, they learn exstensively about The Way. Any enemy army would be very unlucky to be at the end of a zealous soldier's spear."
seekers_reaserchers_path_5:0 "Fleet of Foot, With the Wind In Our Sails"
seekers_reaserchers_path_5_desc:0 "The well-disciplined Seeker legions are used to having to march quickly though the Celtican forests."
seekers_reaserchers_path_6:0 "Seeker Knights"
seekers_reaserchers_path_6_desc:0 "The knights of the Seeker Order are fond of rushing straight into the enemy lines, knowing they will be protected by powerful spells, and their heavy armor."
seekers_reaserchers_path_7:0 "Protected At All Costs"
seekers_reaserchers_path_7_desc:0 "Seeker knights are known for their thick, heavy plate mail, which even dwarven steel will have a difficult time piercing. "
seekers_technica_path_1:0 "Architectural Standards"
seekers_technica_path_1_desc:0 "A common saying about Seeker engineers is that they need two months to draft the plan for a new building, one month to draft the plans, and another month to make sure it looks right."
seekers_technica_path_2:0 "Master of the Fortress"
seekers_technica_path_2_desc:0 "The first thing that is seen when entering a Seeker city is the huge, towering fortifications, and the citadel at the center of the city. An army would be hard-pressed to mount an assault on the well constructed Seeker walls, and they would have to deal with a lengthy siege, all while the defending Seeker battlemages, archers, and ballistae pester the enemy army with spells, arrows, and bolts."
seekers_technica_path_3:0 "Bureau of City Planning"
seekers_technica_path_3_desc:0 "Seeker cities are planned and methodical, with engineers being employed to design every city street, and to make sure everything is up to standard"
seekers_technica_path_4:0 "Natural Fortifications"
seekers_technica_path_4_desc:0 "Many Seeker cities use the natural fortifications to theit benefit. The grand city of Saint Caertugo, is built into the side of a mountain."
seekers_technica_path_5:0 "Leather Saddle Bags"
seekers_technica_path_5_desc:0 "Large leather saddle bags allows soldiers to bring much more supplies with them when on campaign."
seekers_technica_path_6:0 "Technological Workshops"
seekers_technica_path_6_desc:0 "Learned scholars and Mages labor away in workshops, studying new technologies, such as new ways to wage war, grow crops, spread propaganda, and construct stronger and more durable fortifications."
seekers_technica_path_7:0 "Swords For Sale"
seekers_technica_path_7_desc:0 "Foreign mercernaries, although not nearly as skilled or experienced as Seeker legions, make for excellent cannon fodder."
seekers_magica_path_1:0 "A Wizard's Embrace"
seekers_magica_path_1_desc:0 "Mages who have converted to Seekism flock to Seeker controlled cities."
seekers_magica_path_2:0 "Mages and Serfs"
seekers_magica_path_2_desc:0 "In a stark contrast to their neighbors, Seeker cities contain almost zero serfs. Instead, the poorer members of society are encouraged by the state to join a mages guild, all expenses paid for by the state."
seekers_magica_path_3:0 "Magically-Augmented Levies"
seekers_magica_path_3_desc:0 "Mighty battlemages fight alongside Seeker legions, greatly improving the morale of soldiers."
seekers_magica_path_4:0 "Relaxed Recruitment Standard"
seekers_magica_path_4_desc:0 "Expansion of our Mage schools, and recruting less favorable soldiers, will greatly expand our military capacities"
seekers_magica_path_5:0 "The Will to Dominate"
seekers_magica_path_5_desc:0 "Seeker soldiers, the most zealous and faithful in the land, rarely let an enemy army escape without first facing their holy and rightous wrath."
seekers_magica_path_6:0 "Practioners of Defensive Spells"
seekers_magica_path_6_desc:0 "Battlemages cast powerful protection spells on the Seeker legions, ensuring their victory in combat."
seekers_magica_path_7:0 "Magical Advisors"
seekers_magica_path_7_desc:0 "In the Council of every Seeker city, there is a Master Warlock, to advise the Grand Master on all magical matters."

# Snakefolk
snakefolk_philosophy:0 "Ular-Pria Traditions"

snakefolk_warrior_path_1:0 "A Land of Foilage and Snakes"
snakefolk_warrior_path_1_desc:0 "A motto nestled deep within the sacred values of serpentkind, the Ular-Pria consider their very existence to be synonymous with that of Austropetolia whole. To respect your homeland is to yield for yourself all of its bounties, for it protects you, it feeds you, and it shields you, such is the ethos of any general made well endowed by the spirits of war. A competent leader is thus able to not only sustain their cohorts with only the most basal of resources avaialble to them, but to as well utilize the very land against those forces of opposition that greater than their own.\n\n Traps such as pitfalls and snares prove to be one of the many hallkmarks of snakefolk warfare, alongside strategies such as trench warfare which can make any band of relatively fewer serpents into a force nigh impossible to dislodge."

snakefolk_warrior_path_2:0 "Mastery of the Coiled Cobra Technique"
snakefolk_warrior_path_2_desc:0 "It was after the demise of the Ular-Pria lakanate did warfare in much of Austropetolia begin to shift from large, professional troops sourced from all across the provinces, and into smaller, more tight-knit units that placed a large emphasis on ritualized one-on-one confrontations due to the depopulated nature of the snakefolk homeland. With the sinking of much of the land's natural sources of metal, there began a flourishing of ligthly armoured warfare within the newly dotted islands of serpentkind, and to match this emergent style of apparel, new weapons were needed in order to combat against them. \n\nThus forged the mighty kris, a blade tempered like lightning. In the following years after its invention, the new style of sword began spreading all across the lands of the Ular-Pria, and wtith them soon came the rise of numerous techniques based around this one blade. There are many such schools all across the islands inhabited by the snakefolk, but among them one stands out due to its popuarity and range, with its many skills laying the foundations of adjacent orders, the 'Stance of the Coiled Cobra' is meant to be used defensively, in that it eaches its practitioners to evade blows until finally, their opponent has been worn out sufficiently so that they may deliver the final strike."

snakefolk_warrior_path_3:0 "Glorification of the Warrior Broods"
snakefolk_warrior_path_3_desc:0 "During the later stage of the lakanate, in which the country became less and less centralized as the eleventh and final dynasty could no longer keep reigns upon the state, the emergence of the warrior class had begun after two bouts of military protest, in which the armies of the land began clamoring for compensation from the weakening government due to their role in supressing numerous civilian uprisings. In order to placate those angered cohorts, extra privileges were endowed upon snakes of militant service, and as well with the assurance of allotted land in their following years of retirement. \n\nThus, many of serpentkind's modern nobility can trace their lineage back to those ancient warriors from before the Great Collapse of Omniluxia, and thus seek to keep ablaze their warrior heritage by rearing their youth within the rank and file confines of local warbands."

snakefolk_warrior_path_4:0 "Fangs of Serpentkind"
snakefolk_warrior_path_4_desc:0 "Even though much of the great castles of Austropetolia have sunk beneath the waves, the Ular-Pria remain skilled in the art of siege warfare. In fact, within the many warbands of serpentkind there exists a distinct type of warrior whose skills make them both admired and feared by their fellow snakes at arms, known by the hushed named of 'pemuhbunek'. They are the left-hands of espionage and the right-hands of assassination, tasked primarily with the matters of helping take fortresses rather than claiming victory in plain combat. \n\nNot only that, they are also educated to be exceptional provisioners, capable of hunting their quarry not only within the confines of a citadel complex, but as well among the overgrowth of the jungle floor."

snakefolk_warrior_path_5:0 "Of Silk and Poisons"
snakefolk_warrior_path_5_desc:0 "There exist very few metal deposits among the isles of Austropetolia, and so the snakefolk thus resort to new methods of warfare when faced with the dangers of enemy combatants. Typical Ular-Pria armors are made using boiled leather strung underneath a layer of silk fabrics to serves as cushion to help soften blows. \n\nThis type of protection is used primarilly by those warriors who stand well above the ordinary foot soldier, with the base exception being those archers who wield the infamous longbows of Austropetolia, whose arrows are tipped within a poisonous substance local to their respective polities."

snakefolk_warrior_path_6:0 "In Memory of the Lakanate"
snakefolk_warrior_path_6_desc:0 "Within the recent years of serpentkind's history, there has emerged a movement that has sought out the rememberance and glorification of the lakanate of old, wishing to emulate the highly urbanized world their ancestors had lived in. As such, many noble households desire to shift from the their decentralized mode of mobilization, and invest their resources in a professional army, paired with state militias funded directly by subordinate governments. \n\nThough, more often than not did these attempts fails, the efforts of past figures are still recognized in this day and age, where hoepfully more successful governments can attain what they could not."

snakefolk_warrior_path_7:0 "The Hooded Ones"
snakefolk_warrior_path_7_desc:0 "Towards the great empires of man who reign upon the southern landmasses, those capable of utilizing magic are detested as abominations who must be purged. To the northern archipelago of Asutropetolia, however, magic is still celebrated as something not only for its practical purposes, but as well for its spiritual origins. Serpentkind believed that through the blessings of their ancestors, of the prophets and great snakes before them, Ruh is able to flourish within the souls of Ular-Pria. \n\nThough most do not seek out its benefits, and instead seek to maintain those worldly matters that concern them, for those who seek to empower their spirit with mastery of the arcane, then they must look no further than towards the 'sorkobray', the Hooded Ones. A monastic order of esoteric wild mages who seek to safeguard all of serpentkind through mysterious works, it is their agents who make up the majority of the magic users in Austropetolia. To have a member of such an order join your ranks government is an event of extreme prestige among the snakefolk states, with their knowledge in militant commands and mystical forces knowing no bounds."

snakefolk_pirate_path_1:0 "Taming of Sea Monsters"
snakefolk_pirate_path_1_desc:0 "While the skin of the last World Serpent became the Ular-Pria, with his blood forming the seas surrounding and his corpse itself thus degrading into the lands uncountable, the tongue of Ssertryss became something similar to its parent body. Possessed of the wriggling movements of a worm, this squirming piece of a cadaver burrowed itself deep into the confines of the underground, and there it gestated until its forked tip grew heads, becoming the first and last hydra. \n\nIn time, the two heads yearned to love one another in a way they had never known prior, and thus split themselves in half, one male and female, and so copulated which then filled the depths of the earth with serpentine monsters. When the Great Collapse of Omniluxia befell Austropetolia, it opened rifts for which the serpents below used to slither free into the waters above. Since then, the Ular-Pria have accustomed themselves to the presence of their bestial cousins, using them as mounts of war whenever possible."

snakefolk_pirate_path_2:0 "Crab Claw Sails"
snakefolk_pirate_path_2_desc:0 "Well attributed to the serpentkind's ancient ancestors, the crab claw sail has served the Ular-Pria well into the modern age, allowing for a great deal of mobility after the Great Collapse of Omniluxia. In the ancient days, crab claw sails were primarily used by small fishing vessels and trading ships who traversed the inland sea that separated Weaglia from the northern landmass of Old Austrohua. \n\nThough used sparsely by those coastal peoples of the past, vessels designed specifically for conflict  were few and far between among the Ular-Pria, who concerned themselves primarily with the development of land-based combat. After the waves rose, however, the importance of naval warfare became exemplified, and the new waterways became filled with a distinct type of war vessel, the 'karuakua', utilizing the same crab claw sails that had long benifitted serpentkind."

snakefolk_pirate_path_3:0 "Auxiliary Vessels"
snakefolk_pirate_path_3_desc:0 "The role of auxiliary ships cannot be understated within the world of Ular-Pria warfare. Though they do not typically play any actual combative roles in a conflict, they are integral for supplying their comrades in arms for the many days they may spend out upon the open waters. \n\nInitially, most auxiliary ships were simple priavteers, hired by disparate datus in order to raid the settlements of enemy states and distribiute the goods back to allied vessels. In time, they became standardized among the many polities of Austropetolia, constructing whole ships with the designation of an auxiliary vessel who harbored state goods rather than looted possessions."

snakefolk_pirate_path_4:0 "Songs Upon the Water"
snakefolk_pirate_path_4_desc:0 "Among the snakefolk of Austropetolia, there exists a tradition distinct from those foreign warmbloods surrounding them. A type of war ritual that is meant to invigor the souls of all sailors, the 'tapuaka' is ordained under the command of seasoned veterans who have survived more than ten engagements in their lifetime. Accompanied by the sage powers of a wild-mage, the tapuaka's powers are said to gift the recipients with a spirit similar to that of a vicious beast. \n\nWarriors who have undergone such an experience are witnessed to have displayed an unparalleled efficiency in combat, as if they were possessed by the spirits of vengeful deceased."

snakefolk_pirate_path_5:0 "The Art of Goading the Krait"
snakefolk_pirate_path_5_desc:0 "A remnant of the lakanate times, the 'art of goading the krait' is an ancient strategem developed by the admirals of old during their invasion of the savage orc lands. Though many technologies from that period were paired extensively with this tactic, as bombardment from lantaka canons proved to be devestating against the orcanish citadels, the modern Ular-Pria make due with their current situation as they always have in the face of extremity. \n\nNow it is the sling that proves to be the most common of ranged equipment as is seen upon the decks of karakoas, with whole cohorts of slingers able to propel volleys of lightweight explosives into the ranks of any coastal village."

snakefolk_pirate_path_6:0 "Floating Nests of Old Austrohua"
snakefolk_pirate_path_6_desc:0 "Back in those ancient days, the waters of the now expanded Ular-Orcanish Gulf were home to a strange and culturally distinct group of snakefolk, whose tongue was an isolate in comparison to the predominant Prianukra language family. These snakes were the one-hundredand-and-ten clan of the tribe of Ouasuarand, as they are named in the Sayujuro Annals, as well as the myths of their descendents who dot the southern islands. \n\nThey lived in large vessels that could dwarf whole palaces on the mainland, and in these trameandous boats they gathered as a community upon the high seas, spending their whole lives here as one. Though the practice of living primarily upon the waves has since been relegated to only a few populations dispersed across the archipelago of Austropetolia, their designs have since been modified to act more as floating castles by those more martially inclined. "

snakefolk_pirate_path_7:0 "The Right of Karohung"
snakefolk_pirate_path_7_desc:0 "Conflict and bloodshed, these are the two constants that dictate how we live. To be strong is to inflict such things, and to be moral and correct is to be strong. Such is the ethose of much of serpentkind, as such it is considered a simple facet of life that slavery is to be abundant from the western archipelago to the eastern isles. \n\nThe snakefolk as a whole view their people as strong, and thus consider it to be their birthright to enslave those foreign lessers they deem inferior to their blood."

snakefolk_state_path_1:0 "The Elite of Serpentkind"
snakefolk_state_path_1_desc:0 "The nature of Austropetolia's jungle floors and hillish terrain makes it a place suited primarilly for light-weight combatants, and paired with its lack of natural ore deposits, heavy armored infantry are a rarity here in the isles. But when they do make an appearance upon the battlefield, the bronze-scaled nobles of serpentkind are among some of the finest warriors to make battle within the lands of Austropetolia. \n\nIt is a tradition reserved only for the most valiant of aristocratic children, protected head to toe in imported metal from Arteon. However, that was all in the past, for now there exists those islands and coastlines that have reemerged with treasures to be had, allowing for serpentkind to begin mining their own metals, and forging their own designs."

snakefolk_state_path_2:0 "The Striking Swarms"
snakefolk_state_path_2_desc:0 "To move as a ravenous horde is simple and without precision, but to march as a legion with the utmost efficiency and discipline, that is a work of art. With the return of heavy armored infantry into the world of snakefolk warfare, there has been a shift in tactics to better integrate this reemergent type of warrior within the ranks of the military. \n\nThe creation of the 'kamipulon' is thus required to arm these men and women of war, a greatsword endowed with much strength, it is often used by its wielders with the intent of taking the heads of their slain enemies."

snakefolk_state_path_3:0 "Snake Faced Shields"
snakefolk_state_path_3_desc:0 "Bedecked with inconogrophy displaying the natural and spiritual worlds that surround the snakefolk of Austropetolia, the infamous 'sampsanka' targe is a well known piece of equipment made famous in the north in Arteon through the many skirmishes between humnanity and serpentkind, making them a highly requested import among the maritime trade lines of the northern isles. \n\nRound-bodied and composed of boiled leathers, sharp copper edges, a braided wooden surface, and a golden middle are the typical makeup of these kinds of shields."

snakefolk_state_path_4:0 "The Path of Perpetual Violence"
snakefolk_state_path_4_desc:0 "War is something the snakefolk have well accustomed themselves to, and as such view it as a way of life no different than an artist would consider their own profession. It seen as something awe inspiring, a chance for the meek to rise above those who have grown lazy and indulgent. Among the states of Austropetolia, the recruitment of slaves and commoners is a common method by which to recruit eager, and cheap, bodies to take on the more dangerous of military assignments as opposed to sending out those noble children of the ruling aristocracy. \n\nThough many would be offput by such perils, it is all but made up for in the rewards and prestige one can accumulate in this line of work. A chance to become a noble in their own right, there are those  who flock towards these warrior groupings in the hope of finding acceptance amidst their ranks"

snakefolk_state_path_5:0 "The Onokuwal"
snakefolk_state_path_5_desc:0 "The 'onokuwal' are a type of independent warband who yield to no one state, only fighting for sheer thrill of combat, and as well as the supplies needed to maintain their way of life. They are often hard to dislodge, and even the most staunch of datus know better than to pick a fight with these people. \n\nAs such, they have simply co-opted well into the state of warfare within Austropetolia, with even whole communities across the archipelago taking up such a profession as a source of income and alliance with neighboring polities."

snakefolk_state_path_6:0 "The Spirit of All Snakes"
snakefolk_state_path_6_desc:0 "In the myths of serpentkind, there exists the mention of a collective will that inhabits the souls of all snakes. Considered the ghost of all World-Serpents, this raging force is what animates all of serpentkind into a fighting frenzy when needed. It is why they consider all other types of peoples to be inferior, for they do not possess the same 'spirit-energy' like they do.\nCalled 'apamana', the snakefolk view it almsot in the same vein as Ruh, only that it occupies that same space in their souls and works in tandem with it. Whereas as Ruh powers a magical act, Apamana is used for when a serpent finds themselves in more mental and physical situations, able to utilize their burning will to overcome any obstacle."

snakefolk_state_path_7:0 "The Oaths of Leadership"
snakefolk_state_path_7_desc:0 "To lead armies is considered something that should be reserved to a type of person who is not only militarily capable, but as well as morally willed and strong. To entrust someone with the protection of your community, as well as the lives of those men and women they are to lead, to make someone a leader of warriors comes at no easy decision, and people who are chosen for this profession are tested in order to prove themselves in the face of their superiors. \nAs such, the role of oaths and loyalty cannot be overstated within the militaries of serpentkind, for it is what dominates the ranked nature of their armies."

#Silver Dwarves
silver_dwarf_philosophy: "Silver Dwarven Traditions"
silver_dwarf_philosophydesc: ""
dev_sdwarf_path_1: "Hthgart's Legacy"
dev_sdwarf_path_1_desc: "During the golden age of the First Srrørum Kingdom, Hthgart 'to Vernunghaltt' was famous for commissioning large building projects that were lost to time, as well as monumental infrastructure projects that made the kingdom one of the most advanced of its time. Now we must honor him by funding similar projects to improve the lives of our people."
dev_sdwarf_path_2: "Citadels of Old"
dev_sdwarf_path_2_desc: "Our ancestors have left behind incredible defensive structures, such as the Citadel of Hlivikkabi, that have ensured the safety of our valley for centuries. We would benefit greatly from studying the designs and techniques used to build these structures."
dev_sdwarf_path_3: "Organized Storerooms"
dev_sdwarf_path_3_desc: "What many don't tell their children when retelling the story of the Great Zani Invasion is that Ulffgrdd 'to Jallurr' and his men nearly starved before they were relieved by King Hefdarr's army. We should learn from this and ensure that both our armies and garrisons are fully supplied by a system of storerooms to prevent any catastrophe in the future."
dev_sdwarf_path_4: "Mountain Outposts"
dev_sdwarf_path_4_desc: "To keep a land as divided by hills and mountains as ours connected, it was imperative that we create mountain outposts across the various valleys and isolated villages. Now we should use these same tactics to found fortified centers of administration across our realm."
dev_sdwarf_path_5: "Roads of the Mountain King"
dev_sdwarf_path_5_desc: "Long ago, our Kingdom was connected by our great father, Hthgart 'to Vernunghaltt', through a series of roads extending from the major cities to even the most isolated villages. With time, these roads fell into disrepair and became little more than dirt paths. Let us restore these roads and connect our kingdom."
dev_sdwarf_path_6: "Mountain Cities"
dev_sdwarf_path_6_desc: "After having established local centers of administration we've experienced a large influx of rural serfs and freemen migrating into urban centers. We should take advantage of this by developing our fledgling cities and further encouraging migration."
war_sdwarf_path_1: "To Sennjallurr"
war_sdwarf_path_1_desc: "The Iron Wall is the crown tactical achievement of King Hefdarr 'to Togg' and his right hand man, Olltar 'Sennmogg', who used it to decisively win many battles during the Unification Wars. Consisting of three rows of heavily armored pikemen, this 'wall of iron' slowly advances toward the enemy in a tight formation, with the second and third line extending slowly to ward off cavalry. While not the most modern technique, it is certainly a maneuver that we can build off of."
war_sdwarf_path_2: "Centralized Forges"
war_sdwarf_path_2_desc: "A Silver Dwarf's armor is more than just protection, it's a marker of rank and social standing. However, with our kingdom's growth, we need to produce more, stronger armor to provide to our soldiers, many of whom cannot afford the ornate, high quality designs of the nobility. Centralizing the forges around our urban centers should allow blacksmiths to meet this demand as well as collaborate to innovate on previous designs."
war_sdwarf_path_3: "The Silver Caves"
war_sdwarf_path_3_desc: "The highest honor any Silver Dwarf across Morrigon can receive is to be laid to rest in the sacred Silver Caves alongside our father and mother, Hthgart and Ferja. This honor can only be won through glory in the battlefield and through great deeds, and inspires many young dwarves to take up arms and join campaigns without fear of death."
war_sdwarf_path_4: "Warriors of the Mountains"
war_sdwarf_path_4_desc: "The mountains are the natural home of our people. We are familiar with both its blessings and curses, with its beauties and struggles. We must use our ancestral knowledge of this land to our advantage."
war_sdwarf_path_5: "The Sennmoggen"
war_sdwarf_path_5_desc: "The Order of the Sennmoggen are a fierce, disciplined force of elite knights founded by the great Olltar 'Sennmogg'. We must adopt their drills and tactics into our own force to make every one of our soldiers have the quality of a Sennmoggen knight."
war_sdwarf_path_6: "Adopting Foreign Tactics"
war_sdwarf_path_6_desc: "Long ago we were almost pushed back by the Zani at the Battle of Hlivikkabi in 621 LC, with our Galmar brothers falling to their armies in the infamous Sack of Saptabi in 619 LC. We must ensure this never happens again by adapting the technology and the tactics of the foreigners to use against them."
war_sdwarf_path_7: "The Sennkallen"
war_sdwarf_path_7_desc: "Our armies have traditionally consisted of heavily armored knights and pikemen marching in tight formations with auxiliary cavalry. However, by covering both the horse and the rider in thick scale armor, we are able to create cohorts of very heavily armored knights that can smash through enemy cavalry and infantry: The Sennkallen."
war_sdwarf_path_8: "Foreign Auxiliaries"
war_sdwarf_path_8_desc: "While the Silver Dwarves of the Green Valley are staunchly isolationist, the Galmar and Dolin dwarves of Morrigon have had extensive interactions with other races, and have even formed friendships and alliances with them. Through this friendship, many humans, goblins, and even elves have either joined Silver Dwarven armies or been hired as mercenaries."
mixed_sdwarf_path_1: "Litt un Dun"
mixed_sdwarf_path_1_desc: "Just as Hthgart could not exist without Ferja, men cannot exist without women. Our world operates on what we call, 'Light and Dark', an idea that states our world is full of 'lights' that cannot exist without 'darks'. Therefore, a strong family is a strong value of the Silver Dwarven people, and ostracization in our society is akin to death."
mixed_sdwarf_path_2: "Silver Tongues"
mixed_sdwarf_path_2_desc: "The Galmar have earned a nickname among the various people of Northern Morrigon, 'the Silver Tongued Dwarves', as it is said they can talk you into buying a pebble for twenty gold coins. Let us embrace this reputation and support our traders abroad."
mixed_sdwarf_path_3: "Silver Syncretism"
mixed_sdwarf_path_3_desc: "Due to the Dolin and Galmar's centuries of interaction with their neighbors, many neighboring goblins, humans, orcs, and even hobgoblins have adopted certain tenets or ideas of the Hebric faith. Let us promote this syncretism and spread our faith to similar-minded foreigners who honor their ancestors!"
mixed_sdwarf_path_4: "Mountain Men"
mixed_sdwarf_path_4_desc: "Since the Mythic Age infamous 'Gerrmoggen' would perform magical mischief in the hills out of the reach of royal authority. As the world begins to use magic more practically, it is time that we harness these 'Mountain Men' to serve in our administration and army and teach their ancient styles to our mages."
mixed_sdwarf_path_5: "Embracing Foreign Ideas"
mixed_sdwarf_path_5_desc: "Centuries of isolationism has left the Anvindr relatively unaware of new developments in the outside world. Foreign magic, tactics, technology, beliefs, and ideas have changed since the last time our people interacted with the outside world. Let us embrace these foreign ideas and use it to develop our society to be on par with the most advanced kingdoms of Omniluxia!"
mixed_sdwarf_path_6: "Promoting Tradition"
mixed_sdwarf_path_6_desc: "While we must embrace foreign ideas to stand toe-to-toe with the large empires that surround us, we must not forget our traditions and heritage. Our isolationism has allowed us to preserve our ideas and philosophies that our cousins forsook centuries ago, and we should preserve and promote this knowledge to the elites of our society and the general public."
