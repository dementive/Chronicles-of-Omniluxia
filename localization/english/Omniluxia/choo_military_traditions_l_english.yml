 zani_philosophy:0 "Zani Traditions"
 zani_philosophydesc:2 "The Zani Traditions represent the focus on heavily armored and disciplined infantry found in the Eagelia, Zanis and other Eagelian states. They came to favor the sword over the spear, and relied on quickly closing ground with and dispersing less well equipped infantry using strict formations, such as the Triplex Acies, with supporting light cavalry and skirmishers.\n\nFort Defense: #G +25.00%#!.\nCan unlock the '#Y Raid City#!'

 zani_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "The Walled City"
 zani_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "Heavily fortified cities dotted the landscape of the Eagelia for generations. In Zani, the Zani capital wall looms high, built after the catastrophic sacking at the hands of Northners, and affording the inhabitants a small measure of peace from the strife to come."
 
 
 #Zani Tribal Path
 zani_tribal_path_1:0 "Artisanal Metalwork"
 zani_tribal_path_1_desc:0 "Even after the advent of iron-working, magnificent bronze shields, spears, and helmets of all kind, pour from the forges of nascent Zani civilizations. Even tribal cultures possessed a mixture of potent bronze and iron equipment, rendering them a fearsome sight to behold."
 zani_tribal_path_2:0 "The Horseman Order"
 zani_tribal_path_2_desc:0 "In Zani, the horseman constituted an entire sub-class of lords; wealthy aristocracy whose holdings indicated their prestige. As such, the superior wealth and training of the horseman afforded them the liability to serve in the exclusive cavalry contingent of the republic's forces. Elsewhere in the Zani world, warhorses were regarded as the domain of the elite, the horses themselves often being laid to rest alongside their earthly masters in the event of their death."
 zani_tribal_path_3:1 "The First Emperor Devotion"
 zani_tribal_path_3_desc:0 "Relying on the devoutness of their own soldiers, and that of their opponents, the Eagelian rival forces are reputed to have used their priestly orders to curse their foes in plain sight, causing them to rout. In any event, the peoples of ancient Zani left nothing to chance; proper obeisance was made to the First Emperor and the gods, before each battle was made."
 zani_tribal_path_4:0 "The Acquisition of Wealth"
 zani_tribal_path_4_desc:0 "Eagelian tribal cultures, and the nascent Zani Empire all engaged in the practices of raiding, pillaging, and piracy, at times."
 zani_tribal_path_5:0 "The Aulos"
 zani_tribal_path_5_desc:0 "Numerous musical instruments are depicted in Ancient Eagelian art, but none more mysterious than the Aulos. Originally a Intermarenican invention, the signature double-reed and pipes would have been heard accompanying all manner of occasion, perhaps even lifting soldiers' spirits on the eve before battle."
 zani_tribal_path_6:0 "The Zani Fleet"
 zani_tribal_path_6_desc:0 "The coast played a huge part in the economic life of Eagelia. Ships, and viable control over the locality, were vital for the continuation of prosperity in every nascent state. Skilled shipwrights, cheap labor, and abundant building material could be found in all Zani harbors."
 zani_tribal_path_7:0 "Rousing Oratory"
 zani_tribal_path_7_desc:0 "The popularity of the Intermarenican model of democracy spearheaded the empowerment of populist sentiment throughout a land hungry for rights. A skilled orator could sway entire cities in support of his or her cause, which could, at times, be useful."
 zani_tribal_path_end_bonus:0 "Hill Tactics"

 #Zani Support Path
 zani_support_path_1:0 "State Navy"
 zani_support_path_1_desc:0 "Modelled largely on the Ancient Weagaelians designs as well as sporting significant Intermarenican influence, the enthusiasm for naval dominance continued throughout zan's Imperial Golden Age."
 zani_support_path_2:0 "The Zani Sieges"
 latin_support_path_2_desc:0 "The military engineers of the early Zani army were responsible for the design of military structures, as well as the logistical duties associated with organizing their construction."
 zani_support_path_3:0 "Scale the Walls"
 zani_support_path_3_desc:0 "Siege engines were scarcely used in the early Empire, sieges instead relying on covert attempts to scale the walls as well as sieges of attrition."
 zani_support_path_4:0 "Castrum"
 zani_support_path_4_desc:0 "Cohorts, and later legions, were adept at constructing temporary; and in many cases permanent, fortresses, which served as resupply depots, rallying points, or as bases to extend a zone of military control over an unpacified area."
 zani_support_path_5:0 "Logistics of State"
 zani_support_path_5_desc:0 "As the Zani military expanded, the practice of each soldier providing his own weapons became unsustainable. Thus, by instituting a chain of supply, from natural resources, to blacksmith, to the hands of her soldiers, The Zanis fueled her war machine with ease."
 zani_support_path_6:0 "Shield walls"
 zani_support_path_6_desc:0 "Adopting the iconic shield, the Zani shields, alongside the development of the manipular system, gave the Zanis a decisive advantage over her local enemies. Subsequently, the scutum became almost a national icon for the Zanis; the very presence of a Zani shield wall was often enough to win a battle before it started."
 zani_support_path_7:0 "Foederati"
 zani_support_path_7_desc:0 "Zani's primary source of cavalry in the mid-Imperial age, had shifted from the horseman order to mercenaries and allied states. This allowed a diverse array of styles and abilities to be incorporated into the ever-growing Zani military."
 zani_support_path_end_bonus:0 "Zani, Ascendant"
 zani_support_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "After a great victory, Zanis custom dictated that honor be paid to the responsible commander. Lavish celebrations, often encompassing athletic events, feasts, and processions, would occupy the city for days - reinforcing in friend and foe alike, the might of the Zani."

 #Zani imperial Path
 zani_roman_path_1:0 "Heavy Infantry"
 zani_roman_path_1_desc:0 "Veteran warriors all, the wealthy Swordmen sported heavy armor, and fought in tight-knit maniples, making excellent line troops."
 zani_roman_path_2:0 "Triplex Acies"
 zani_roman_path_2_desc:0 "This highly flexible formation relied on the absolute discipline of each soldier, who had to know his place amidst the chaos of battle. In extreme circumstances, the Triplex was said to have reached over a mile long." 
 zani_roman_path_3:0 "Heavy Infantry discipline"
 zani_roman_path_3_desc:0 "It is said that Zani's opponents know the end is near when the Triarii lead the charge. Often used to rout an already exhausted foe, the Triarii were equipped with huge spears known as hasta, capable of punching through light armor."
 zani_roman_path_4:0 "Zani Roads"
 zani_roman_path_4_desc:0 "Often credited with winning entire wars, the practice of using the military to build roads, both in peace time and in conflict, was literally world-shaping."
 zani_roman_path_5:0 "Professional Soldiers"
 zani_roman_path_5_desc:0 "The evolution of a levied fighting force into a professional standing army, paid dividends in terms of quality and expectation. The salaried soldier was much less likely to baulk at orders, or flee from combat."
 zani_roman_path_6:0 "Skimirshers corps"
 zani_roman_path_6_desc:0 "Comprised predominantly of young, unproven soldiers, the Skimirshers corps were light troops which fell outside the standard army organisation, instead acting as mobile skirmishers. The Skimirshers corps are said to have sought glory and recognition by their daredevil acts during battle."
 zani_roman_path_7:0 "The Honor of Service"
 zani_roman_path_7_desc:0 "As the Zanis grew in stature, military service became a matter of honor for young Zani men."
 zani_roman_path_end_bonus:0 "March of the Eagles"
 zani_roman_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Irrespective of victory or defeat, as long as the eagle stands proud, the spirit of Rome imbues all her sons."

 levantine_greco_path_6_desc:0 "The Ptolemaic navy was consistently in a process of development, not least due to the difficulty of obtaining appropriate building material.

 levantine_greco_path_7:0 "Unending Riches"
 levantine_greco_path_7_desc:0 "The obscene wealth of the Ptolemaic dynasty, and the desperate need for experienced commanders, led to exorbitant sums being offered to any foreign generals who would work for them. Loyalty may be expensive, but it can be bought."

 levantine_greco_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Having seen Zani troops in action, the Baetepians and Phanicians  attempted to mimic aspects of Zani military philosophy in their own forces.

 #####Morrigon Celts
 ######
 celtic_philosophy:0 "Morrigon Celts Traditions"
 celtic_philosophydesc:3 "The Barbarian Traditions encompass the fighting styles of the peoples of vetalian, rohenoan, borderlander, and celtican, among others. They mostly relied on large formations of lightly armored infantry equipped with spears or swords, supported by nimble chariot formations or light cavalry, and made extensive use of ambush tactics, especially in forests.\n\nCan unlock the '#Y Raise Levies#!' Ability\nCan unlock the '#Y Hit and Run#!' Tactic\n\n#G Tradition Focuses#!\nStrong #Y Light Infantry#!\nGood #Y Archers#!, #Y Chariots#!"
 celtic_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "Chariot Culture"
 celtic_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "The use of chariots in warfare stems back many thousands of years, and holds strong affiliations with nobility and class; chariot inhumations speak to the honor that can be won through battle. Chariots themselves were commonly used as mobile platforms with two to three occupants, from which javelins or other thrown weapons were used to break the ranks of their opponents."
 #Britannic
 celtic_britannic_path_1:0 "Scythed Chariots"
 celtic_britannic_path_1_desc:0 "Affixing scything blades to the wheels of our chariots, adds a lethal deterrent to anyone foolhardy enough to assault them."
 celtic_britannic_path_2:0 "Coming of Age"
 celtic_britannic_path_2_desc:0 "From a young age, our children are taught that they may be called upon to defend their settlements. If every man bears responsibility for arming himself, armies can be raised from the very salt of the earth."
 celtic_britannic_path_3:0 "Living off the Land"
 celtic_britannic_path_3_desc:0 "Our people know the ways of the land better than most; which berries and plants are edible, and which natural remedies can be used to salve wounds."
 celtic_britannic_path_4:0 "Word of Mouth"
 celtic_britannic_path_4_desc:0 "Whether it be a chance for glory, an opportunity for loot, or merely to revel in the slaughter, news of an imminent battle draws even the elders to our ranks."
 celtic_britannic_path_5:0 "Chariot Mastery"
 celtic_britannic_path_5_desc:0 "The terror inspired by a massed chariot attack, can be sufficient to break even the most battle-hardened formations."
 celtic_britannic_path_6:0 "Selective Breeding"
 celtic_britannic_path_6_desc:0 "Revered throughout the bronze age and before, as evident in the chalk hill carvings throughout Vetalia, the strong-backed domestic horse is a result of thousands of years of selective breeding, and capable of carrying a single rider into battle."
 celtic_britannic_path_7:0 "Take up Arms"
 celtic_britannic_path_7_desc:0 "Every man has a place in our armies; not least the hunters, who stalk their prey on battlefield and forest alike."
 celtic_britannic_path_end_bonus:0 "Trained Cavalry"
 celtic_britannic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Domestic horses, while sufficient for defense in emergencies, are inclined to panic on the battlefield. Thus, by expanding our stock of horses bred and trained for war, our bold warriors will excel at their true purpose: carnage."
 #Germanic
 celtic_germanic_path_1:0 "Strike and Withdraw"
 celtic_germanic_path_1_desc:0 "The relative fitness of our warriors, combined with our people's contempt for cumbersome equipment, allows us to outmaneuver traditional armies with ease. By harrying our opponents' flanks, they will likely lose enthusiasm for the fight before we do."
 celtic_germanic_path_2:0 "Natural Resources"
 celtic_germanic_path_2_desc:0 "The abundance of arable land and vast tracts of land sporting workable wood, give us unparalleled access to the resources we need to create weapons of war."
 celtic_germanic_path_3:0 "Ambush"
 celtic_germanic_path_3_desc:0 "While a combination of factors contributed to this, the Marshlander familiarity with the dense terrain was a major one."
 celtic_germanic_path_4:0 "The Glory of the Hunt"
 celtic_germanic_path_4_desc:0 "Tribal warfare is a brutal affair. The seizure of slaves, women and valuables is a time-honored practice which we ought not to forgo."
 celtic_germanic_path_5:0 "Shield Wall"
 celtic_germanic_path_5_desc:0 "Rohenoan troops often surprised their opponents by utilizing a core of heavily shielded warriors, acting as a deterrent to attackers, and as a particularly cohesive and mobile unit on the battlefield."
 celtic_germanic_path_6:0 "The Young Must Serve"
 celtic_germanic_path_6_desc:0 "Learning the art of warfare is a vital part of every youth's education. If a child can wield a sword and maintain their equipment, then they are ready for war."
 celtic_germanic_path_7:0 "Hail of Stones"
 celtic_germanic_path_7_desc:0 "Those unable or unwilling to hold an axe, learn the art of the sling, or bow. A simple tool it may seem, but even mighty giants can be felled by a single stone."
 celtic_germanic_path_end_bonus:0 "Adaptability"
 celtic_germanic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Our brave soldiers may be the fiercest the world has seen, but true humility comes in learning from our defeats. By adopting tactics we encounter on the battlefield, from those who consider themselves more 'civilized', we may outdo any fighting force we meet."
 #Gallic
 celtic_gallic_path_1:0 "Strike From Afar"
 celtic_gallic_path_1_desc:0 "Huntsmen and skirmishers practice from a young age, honing their skills on wildlife and those unlucky enough to constitute a target."
 celtic_gallic_path_2:0 "Confederations"
 celtic_gallic_path_2_desc:0 "Many tribes maintained close relations with their neighbors, guaranteeing a certain amount of cooperation when it came to battle. Warbands likely comprised members of many different local tribes, all fighting for glory."
 celtic_gallic_path_3:0 "The Plains Fight With us"
 celtic_gallic_path_3_desc:0 "The rolling plains of Rohenoa, from the coast to the Alps, prove ideal terrain for the use of cavalry."
 celtic_gallic_path_4:0 "In Defense of our Home"
 celtic_gallic_path_4_desc:0 "From blacksmiths to traders, when our hill forts and rural settlements are threatened, all shall take up arms and stand united."
 celtic_gallic_path_5:0 "A People on the Move"
 celtic_gallic_path_5_desc:0 "Our ancestors moved freely, uncaring of borders or territorial claims. These nomadic traditions live on, as our people live in constant readiness to seek out pastures greener than their own."
 celtic_gallic_path_6:0 "Strong Arm"
 celtic_gallic_path_6_desc:0 "While most of our warriors eschew the protection afforded by mail, our strong-armed and well equipped javelin-throwers clad themselves in armor, and can hurl iron-tipped spears capable of punching through plate armor, flesh, and bone."
 celtic_gallic_path_7:0 "Scale the Walls!"
 celtic_gallic_path_7_desc:1 "Our people have taken to residing in walled territories, which, while well-defended, have weaknesses, if one knows where to look."
 celtic_gallic_path_end_bonus:0 "Blow the Trumpet, in the New Moon!"
 celtic_gallic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The Carnyx, a trumpet possessed of a harsh and instantly recognizable timbre, inspires our troops, while terrifying our opponents."
