The island of #Y Arteon#! is already struggling in general, and the last thing anyone wants is a full-blown refugee crisis.\n\nAs of late, the disagreements between the two countries seem to have become personal, and at this rate, the [GetCountry('MH1').GetRulerTitle|Y] of [GetCountry('MH1').GetName|Y] and the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle|G] of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|G] are going to plunge their countries into war."
