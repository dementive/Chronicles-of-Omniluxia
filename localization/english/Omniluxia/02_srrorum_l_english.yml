03_srrorum: "Dreams of Srrokheim"
03_srrorum_DESCRIPTION: "With the #E Green Valley#! united for the first time in centuries, our people can now focus on reclaiming the full borders of [GetCharacter('(int32)75').GetName]'s #E Kingdom#!. Our people once inhabited great cities in the #E Gorrskkóen Forests#!, coasts of the #E Southern Sea#!, and the #E Dragon's Pass#!, however with the death of [GetCharacter('(int32)75').GetName] and the #E Elven#!, #E Goblin#!, and #E Hobgoblin#! invasions, our people were restricted to just our homeland of the #E Green Valley#!.\n\n Now our people once again dream of #E Srrokheim#!, and repopulating #E Southern Morrigon#! in our image!"
03_srrorum_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] conquers all of Southern Morrigon."
03_srrorum_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Let us follow the dream of Srrokheim!"

#Missions 
####ARMY
03_srrorum_task_1: "Beyond the Valley"
03_srrorum_task_1_DESC: "Now that we've united the valley under our banner, it's time to dream bigger. Long ago, our ancestors controlled nearly all of #E Southern Morrigon#!, from the #E Green Valley#! to the #E Dragon's Pass#!. The first step to retake our empire will be to look beyond the confines of our homeland."

03_srrorum_task_2: "The Western Gate"
03_srrorum_task_2_DESC: "Just as the #E Eastern Gate#! protects us from #E #R Elven#!#! raiders, the #E Western Gate#! has prevented #E Silver Dwarven#! war bands from invading the hill tribes of the #E Western Lungs Forest#!. If we have any hopes of reaching the #E Dragon's Pass#!, we must first conquer the entrance to the lands of the #E #R Western Forest Elves#!#!!"

03_srrorum_task_3: "Preparing Our Forces"
03_srrorum_task_3_DESC: "What used to be #E Gorrskkóen Forest#! was changed irreversibly millennia ago by #E #R Forest Elven#!#! immigrants, who introduced the #E #R Yaga Trees#!#! which came to dominate the landscape and created what is now the #E Western Lungs Forest#!. Filled with mana, these trees are practically impossible to burn, live for centuries, and affect the environment around them, creating dangerous #E #R Fai#!#! out of what used to be the surrounding fauna and flora. While the #E #R Forest Elves#!#! thrive in this environment, those trees are the main reason nearly any invasion of their territory is met with failure.\nFortunately, #E Dragkhanic#! mages from the #E Dragonscale School of Defensive Magic#! have been teaching the #E Zare Jad#! style in [GetProvince('(int32)3988').GetName], which, with some investment, might be able to shield our armies from the various hazards found in the #E #R Eldritch Forests#!#!!"

03_srrorum_task_4: "Conquering the Elves"
03_srrorum_task_4_DESC: "With our armies prepared, we must learn from previous armies who have attempted and failed to invade the vast Eldritch Forests of the Western Forest Elves. Our opponents are divided into many tribes, a fact we can exploit. If we strike fast and ensure our armies are safe from the Fai, we can dominate the Western Lungs Forest!"

03_srrorum_task_5: "Securing Our Borders"
03_srrorum_task_5_DESC: "While we try to control the unruly Elves, we should be wary of the opportunistic Cumbrians to our west. Securing our border is the only way to prevent a future invasion of our new holdings during a time of weakness!"

03_srrorum_task_6: "The Silk Cities"
03_srrorum_task_6_DESC: "The Three Silokhai, or Silk Cities, of the Admadi Elves are the most sophisticated urban centers in the Western Lungs Forest, as well as the largest silk producers in all of Morrigon. Needing to more effectively control the elves, we could develop these cities into centers of administration for us to better manage our new conquests!"

03_srrorum_task_7: "Resettling the Forest"
03_srrorum_task_7_DESC: "Once, the Gorrskkóen Forest was home to large cities such as Steffanskkópiabi and Gorrvlikkabi, cities that were consumed by the unending forests that the Elven invaders brought. Overwhelming us with their forest magic, our cities and communities were lost, and we were confined to the Green Valley. However, we are once again the masters of the now Western World Lungs Forest, and we should send Anvindr settlers to go and reclaim our cities from the Elven trespassers and their demonic eldritch forests."

03_srrorum_task_8: "Ports on the Southern Sea"
03_srrorum_task_8_DESC: "Through our conquests we've found ourselves in possession of vast lands suitable for ports. With some investment, we can make ourselves an important player in the Southern Sea Trade, exporting vast amounts of minerals and wood from our new ports to fill our coffers!"

03_srrorum_task_9: "Into the Western Plains"
03_srrorum_task_9_DESC: "Having full control over the Western Lungs Forests, we must continue east towards to Dragon's Pass. In our path stand the unruly Dragkhan tribes of the Western Plains as well as the few Sovenerian holdings who block us from reaching our final goal. Defeating them will be tough, however, their conquests will serve as excellent experience for our soldiers, who will eventually have to face the fiercer Hobgoblins to the North."

03_srrorum_task_10: "Entering the Dragon's Pass"
03_srrorum_task_10_DESC: "At long last we have managed to make it to the mountains of the Dragon's Pass. Our veteran soldiers now face the armies of the Ahualtzi Hobgoblins. Hardened by centuries of invasions and raids from Dragkhanic tribes and neighboring Hobgoblin states, the Ahualtzi are formidable warriors and the mountainous nature of their homeland will make it difficult for our forces. However, victory should be a needed morale boost for our tired soldiers."

03_srrorum_task_11: "The Hobgoblin Plains"
03_srrorum_task_11_DESC: "Having conquered the Ahualtzi, we now face the formidable kingdoms of the Droyuni and Tileshkelaz. Organized around the two major cities of Driotrai and Tlazcal, their armies are numerous and their conquest will be difficult. However, the Urhuk nomads of the east mirror the Hobgoblins that razed the great Silver Dwarven cities of the Dragon's Pass, and their conquest will be particularly cathartic for our people."

03_srrorum_task_12: "Securing the Entrances"
03_srrorum_task_12_DESC: "Having defeated the Hobgoblin threat, our former friends, the Sovenarians, and the Borderlander tribes of the North now look hungrily at the chaos we've created. To secure our holdings, it's imperative that we control all of the entrances of the Dragon's Pass, from the unruly northern kingdom of the Jishani, to the savage Kana'i goblin tribes of the Inner Dragon's Pass."

03_srrorum_task_13: "Resettling the Dragon's Pass"
03_srrorum_task_13_DESC: "While scant few mages have existed in our highlands and in Veddabi for centuries, the widespread distrust of mages in silver dwarven culture has caused the mage community in our nation to be relatively small and underdeveloped. To help grow our small community of ragtag mages, the King has sent diplomats to the great schools of the Dragkhan to bring back mages willing to teach our young talent."

03_srrorum_task_14: "Rebuilding Our Cities"
03_srrorum_task_14_DESC: "The oldest tablets in Veddtunn tell of grand Silver Dwarven cities that towered above the bleak landscape of the Dragon's Pass; Hthgartgerrpiabi, Hæjbaenabi, Ásennabi. Rebuilding these ancient cities will attract more migrants and stronger control over our new lands!"

03_srrorum_task_15: "Mythic Relics"
03_srrorum_task_15_DESC: "Records from the Mythic Age are hard to find, but oral traditions describe our ancestors as the most advanced in the world, able to produce unbreakable Mythril and long-lasting Dverpi Coal in large quantities and with ease. By sending out explorers, adventurers, and academics into the Dragon's Pass we may be able to find fragments of their forgotten technology that we may be able to use."

03_srrorum_task_16: "Restore Srrokheim"
03_srrorum_task_16_DESC: "While our forefathers dreamed of a restoration of Srrorum, we dream bigger, we dream grander, we dream of empire; of Srrokheim, the Empire of the Silver Dwarves."

####DEVELOPMENT
03_srrorum_task_17: "Fortifying the Gates"
03_srrorum_task_17_DESC: "Now that we control both sides of the pass that leads into the Green Valley, we must ensure that our homeland can never again be threatened by outside invaders. Fortifying both of the gates should make the entrance to the Green Valley impenetrable!"

03_srrorum_task_18: "Royal Roads"
03_srrorum_task_18_DESC: "Long ago in the Mythic Age, we were ruled by the legendary Hthgart 'to Vernunghaltt', who was known for his large infrastructure projects. Perhaps one of his most famous projects were the Royal Roads, stretching from the Sacred Silver Caves to the Eastern Gate, connecting all of the Green Valley to the outside world. With the passing centuries his work has decayed to mere dirt roads and paths. It is time that we honor our dear father and rebuild his vast road network."

03_srrorum_task_19: "Reinforcing the Faith"
03_srrorum_task_19_DESC: "With our conquest of foreign peoples and our embrace of foreign ideas, many new heretical beliefs have begun permeating our society. In order to strengthen belief in the ancestors, a series of grand temples must be built in the major cities of the valley to house and organize a priesthood that can help enforce the proper traditions and rituals that have been uniquely present in Silver Dwarven society and religion since the Mythic Age!"

03_srrorum_task_20: "A Center of the Faith"
03_srrorum_task_20_DESC: "Long considered the center of the universe by our people, the Silver Caves near Srrovikkabi are the holiest site in the Silver Dwarven world. However, the city of Srrovikkabi itself isn't as grand. While it is the home of the Order of Sennmoggen, it does not have enough housing or temples for the great influx of pilgrims that arrive each year.\n\nWith some investment, we can turn this minor stop on the way to the caves into a grand center of our faith!"

03_srrorum_task_21: "The City of Knowledge"
03_srrorum_task_21_DESC: "Veddabi is the educational and magical heart of our nation. To be able to catch up to the better developed magic and technology of the outside world, we should ensure that the 'City of Knowledge' is rebuilt to house much more than just a couple of academies for noble students!"

03_srrorum_task_22: "Gerrtágadi Style"
03_srrorum_task_22_DESC: "The Gerrmoggen, or 'Mountain Men', have been causing chaos and performing esoteric magic in the hills of the Green Valley since the Mythic Age. Their isolation from other mages and unique terrain has led them to develop a unique style that is not seen anywhere else in Omniluxia.\n\nOur mages at Veddborr are eager to attract as many of these magical wanderers as possible to establish the first domestic Silver Dwarven magic school at the recently expanded Veddborr. With some funding and encouragement from the state, we could help create and spread this new style among new Anvindr Mages."

03_srrorum_task_23: "Verobaen Farms"
03_srrorum_task_23_DESC: "Due to increasing urbanization, our cities are attracting new migrants that are contributing to a boom in our population. However, due to the limited amount of arable land in the valley and the increased demand for food, there are many concerns that our cities will starve.\n\nA group of academics have recently reached out to the King to ask for funding for a new research project that could solve this problem. The Verobaen Farms of the Mythic Age were large farms carved into the mountains that created artificial arable land. With our help, they might be able to create new farms in a similar style that could replicate the Verobaen Farms of old!"
