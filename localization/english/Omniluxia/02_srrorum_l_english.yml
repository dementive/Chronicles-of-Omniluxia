#Missions 
####ARMY
03_srrorum_task_1: "Beyond the Valley"
03_srrorum_task_1_DESC: "Now that we've united the valley under our banner, it's time to dream bigger. Long ago, our ancestors controlled nearly all of Southern Morrigon, from the Green Valley to the Dragon's Pass. The first step to retake our empire will be to look beyond the confines of our small valley."

03_srrorum_task_2: "The Western Gate"
03_srrorum_task_2_DESC: "Just as the Eastern Gate protects us from Elven raiders, the Western Gate has historically prevented Silver Dwarven war bands from invading the Western Lungs Forest. If we have any hopes of reaching the Dragon’s Pass, we must first obtain the entrance to the lands of the Western Forest Elves."

03_srrorum_task_3: "Preparing Our Forces"
03_srrorum_task_3_DESC: "What used to be Gørrskkóen Forest was changed irreversibly millennia ago by Forest Elven immigrants, who introduced the Yaga Trees which came to dominate the landscape and created what is now the Western Lungs Forest. Filled with mana, these trees are practically impossible to burn, live for centuries, and affect the environment around them, creating dangerous Fai out of what used to be the surrounding fauna and flora. While the Forest Elves thrive in this environment, those trees are the main reason nearly any invasion of their territory is met with failure.\nFortunately, Dragkhanic mages from the Dragonscale School of Defensive Magic in Veddabi have been teaching some of our mages the Zare Jad Style, which, with some investment, might be able to shield our armies from the various hazards found in the Eldritch Forests."

03_srrorum_task_4: "Conquering the Elves"
03_srrorum_task_4_DESC: "With our armies prepared, we must learn from previous armies who have attempted and failed to invade the vast Eldritch Forests of the Western Forest Elves. Our opponents are divided into many tribes, a fact we can exploit. If we strike fast and ensure our armies are safe from the Fai, we can dominate the Western Lungs Forest!"

03_srrorum_task_5: "Securing Our Borders"
03_srrorum_task_5_DESC: "While we try to control the unruly Elves, we should be wary of the opportunistic Cumbrians to our west. Securing our border is the only way to prevent a future invasion of our new holdings during a time of weakness!"

03_srrorum_task_6: "The Silk Cities"
03_srrorum_task_6_DESC: "The Three Silokhai, or Silk Cities, of the Admadi Elves are the most sophisticated urban centers in the Western Lungs Forest, as well as the largest silk producers in all of Morrigon. Needing to more effectively control the elves, we could develop these cities into centers of administration for us to better manage our new conquests!"

03_srrorum_task_7: "Resettling the Forest"
03_srrorum_task_7_DESC: "Once, the Gørrskkóen Forest was home to large cities such as Steffanskkópiabi and Gørrvlikkabi, cities that were consumed by the unending forests that the Elven invaders brought. Overwhelming us with their forest magic, our cities and communities were lost, and we were confined to the Green Valley. However, we are once again the masters of the now Western World Lungs Forest, and we should send Anvindr settlers to go and reclaim our cities from the Elven trespassers and their demonic eldritch forests."

03_srrorum_task_8: "Ports on the Southern Sea"
03_srrorum_task_8_DESC: "Through our conquests we've found ourselves in possession of vast lands suitable for ports. With some investment, we can make ourselves an important player in the Southern Sea Trade, exporting vast amounts of minerals and wood from our new ports to fill our coffers!"

03_srrorum_task_9: "Into the Western Plains"
03_srrorum_task_9_DESC: "Having full control over the Western Lungs Forests, we must continue east towards to Dragon's Pass. In our path stand the unruly Dragkhan tribes of the Western Plains as well as the few Sovenerian holdings who block us from reaching our final goal. Defeating them will be tough, however, their conquests will serve as excellent experience for our soldiers, who will eventually have to face the fiercer Hobgoblins to the North."

03_srrorum_task_10: "Entering the Dragon's Pass"
03_srrorum_task_10_DESC: "At long last we have managed to make it to the mountains of the Dragon's Pass. Our veteran soldiers now face the armies of the Ahualtzi Hobgoblins. Hardened by centuries of invasions and raids from Dragkhanic tribes and neighboring Hobgoblin states, the Ahualtzi are formidable warriors and the mountainous nature of their homeland will make it difficult for our forces. However, victory should be a needed morale boost for our tired soldiers."

03_srrorum_task_11: "The Hobgoblin Plains"
03_srrorum_task_11_DESC: "Having conquered the Ahualtzi, we now face the formidable kingdoms of the Droyuni and Tileshkelaz. Organized around the two major cities of Driotrai and Tlazcal, their armies are numerous and their conquest will be difficult. However, the Urhuk nomads of the east mirror the Hobgoblins that razed the great Silver Dwarven cities of the Dragon's Pass, and their conquest will be particularly cathartic for our people."

03_srrorum_task_12: "Securing the Entrances"
03_srrorum_task_12_DESC: "Having defeated the Hobgoblin threat, our former friends, the Sovenarians, and the Borderlander tribes of the North now look hungrily at the chaos we’ve created. To secure our holdings, it’s imperative that we control all of the entrances of the Dragon’s Pass, from the unruly northern kingdom of the Jishani, to the savage Kāna’i goblin tribes of the Inner Dragon’s Pass."

03_srrorum_task_13: "Resettling the Dragon's Pass"
03_srrorum_task_13_DESC: "While scant few mages have existed in our highlands and in Veddabi for centuries, the widespread distrust of mages in silver dwarven culture has caused the mage community in our nation to be relatively small and underdeveloped. To help grow our small community of ragtag mages, the King has sent diplomats to the great schools of the Dragkhan to bring back mages willing to teach our young talent."

03_srrorum_task_14: "Rebuilding Our Cities"
03_srrorum_task_14_DESC: "The oldest tablets in Veddtunn tell of grand Silver Dwarven cities that towered above the bleak landscape of the Dragon's Pass: Hthgartgerrpiabi, Hæjbaenabi, Ásennabi. Rebuilding these ancient cities will attract more migrants and stronger control over our new lands!"

03_srrorum_task_15: "Mythic Relics"
03_srrorum_task_15_DESC: "Records from the Mythic Age are hard to find, but oral traditions describe our ancestors as the most advanced in the world, able to produce unbreakable Mythril and long-lasting Dverpi Coal in large quantities and with ease. By sending out explorers, adventurers, and academics into the Dragon's Pass we may be able to find fragments of their forgotten technology that we may be able to use."

03_srrorum_task_16: "Restore Srrøkheim"
03_srrorum_task_16_DESC: "While our forefathers dreamed of a restoration of Srrørum, we dream bigger, we dream grander, we dream of empire, of Srrøkheim, the Empire of the Silver Dwarves."

####DEVELOPMENT
03_srrorum_task_17: "Fortifying the Gates"
03_srrorum_task_17_DESC: "Now that we control both sides of the pass that leads into the Green Valley, we must ensure that our homeland can never again be threatened by outside invaders. Fortifying both of the gates should make the entrance to the Green Valley impenetrable!"

03_srrorum_task_18: "Royal Roads"
03_srrorum_task_18_DESC: "Long ago in the Mythic Age, we were ruled by the legendary Hthgart 'tö Vernunghaltt', who was known for his large infrastructure projects. Perhaps one of his most famous projects were the Royal Roads, stretching from the Sacred Silver Caves to the Eastern Gate, connecting all of the Green Valley to the outside world. With the passing centuries his work has decayed to mere dirt roads and paths. It is time that we honor our dear father and rebuild his vast road network."

03_srrorum_task_19: "Reinforcing the Faith"
03_srrorum_task_19_DESC: "With our conquest of foreign peoples and our embrace of foreign ideas, many new heretical beliefs have begun permeating our society. In order to strengthen belief in the ancestors, a series of grand temples must be built in the major cities of the valley to house and organize a priesthood that can help enforce the proper traditions and rituals that have been uniquely present in Silver Dwarven society and religion since the Mythic Age!"

03_srrorum_task_20: "A Center of the Faith"
03_srrorum_task_20_DESC: "Long considered the center of the universe by our people, the Silver Caves near Srrøvikkabi are the holiest site in the Silver Dwarven world. However, the city of Srrøvikkabi itself isn't as grand. While it is the home of the Order of Sennmöggen, it does not have enough housing or temples for the great influx of pilgrims that arrive each year.\n\nWith some investment, we can turn this minor stop on the way to the caves into a grand center of our faith!"

03_srrorum_task_21: "The City of Knowledge"
03_srrorum_task_21_DESC: "Veddabi is the educational and magical heart of our nation. To be able to catch up to the better developed magic and technology of the outside world, we should ensure that the 'City of Knowledge' is rebuilt to house much more than just a couple of academies for noble students!"

03_srrorum_task_22: "Gerrtágadi Style"
03_srrorum_task_22_DESC: "The Gerrmöggen, or 'Mountain Men', have been causing chaos and performing esoteric magic in the hills of the Green Valley since the Mythic Age. Their isolation from other mages and unique terrain has led them to develop a unique style that is not seen anywhere else in Omniluxia.\n\nOur mages at Veddborr are eager to attract as many of these magical wanderers as possible to establish the first domestic Silver Dwarven magic school at the recently expanded Veddborr. With some funding and encouragement from the state, we could help create and spread this new style among new Anvindr Mages."

03_srrorum_task_23: "Veröbaen Farms"
03_srrorum_task_23_DESC: "Due to increasing urbanization, our cities are attracting new migrants that are contributing to a boom in our population. However, due to the limited amount of arable land in the valley and the increased demand for food, there are many concerns that our cities will starve.\n\nA group of academics have recently reached out to the King to ask for funding for a new research project that could solve this problem. The Veröbaen Farms of the Mythic Age were large farms carved into the mountains that created artificial arable land. With our help, they might be able to create new farms in a similar style that could replicate the Veröbaen Farms of old!"

####CONQUEST
meritocracy_mod: "Meritocracy"
desc_meritocracy_mod: "Just like King Hefdarr before him, Hartbaltt's reforms have ensured that his state is a meritocracy, allowing him to choose the best and brightest to help him run the nation."
sennfernnen_mod: "Sennfernnen"
desc_sennfernnen_mod: "Building off of the Sennjallurr, the Sennfernnen, or the 'Iron Squares', creates smaller unites of 50 heavily armored pikemen that move across the battlefield semi-independently, protecting themselves from cavalry and allowing them to be more maneuverable than the previous Sennjallurr allowed them to be."
warded_armies_mod: "Zare Jad Style"
desc_warded_armies_mod: "An Omnisavand class style, Zare Jad is a defensive style that is primarily taught in the Dragonscale School of Defensive Magic. It's techniques include various warding spells that range from simple mana walls to being able to create army-size mana shields."
gerrbaen_expanded_mod: "Gerrbaen Expanded"
desc_gerrbaen_expanded_mod: "Gerrbaen is a large complex of public and private farms and gardens etched into the nearby Green Mountain from which the city of Gørrgerrabi was named after. Built much like the Veröbaen farms of the Mythic Age, it grew to it's largest extent in 645 LC, where it decayed in use until it was recently expanded to accomodate the Gørrgerrabi's growth."
sennkallen_mod: "Sennkallen"
desc_sennkallen_mod: "The Sennkallen are regiments of heavily armored cavalry very similar to Cataphracts of some human states, and can smash into lightly defended infantry and cavalry."

####DEVELOPMENT
restored_brewery_mod: "Htgarth Brewery Restored"
desc_restored_brewery_mod: "Due to rumored disputes with his sons, the legendary founder of Htgath Brewery, Hlffsten, buried his secrets with him when he died in 954 LC, leading the brewery to fall into a decline. However, with some investment, it's operations were once again expanded and it's name spread to all corners of the Green Valley."
expanded_academy_mod: "Expanded Academies"
desc_expanded_academies_mod: "The 'City of Knowledge', Veddabi, hosts numerous universities and academies, and young nobles from across the Green Valley are often sent there to learn about the ancient classics, mathematics, sciences, and the limited amount of magical knowledge available. By expanding their operations, we can offer higher education to more than just the richest aristocratic families in our realm!"
expanded_mines_mod: "The Mines of Púkklantenath"
desc_expanded_mines_mod: "The mines of Púkklantenath are known as the 'Demon Lands', since the Soul Gems found there often emit a powerful aura that unnerves the stereotypically suspicious and magiphobic Silver Dwarves of the area."
state_funded_farms_mod: "State Funded Farms"
desc_state_funded_farms_mod: "Hartbaltt's farming reforms has generated tax breaks and incentives for lords in the few farmlands of the realm to be able to expand their operations and host more serfs on their lands."
palace_mod: "Hartbaltt's Palace"
desc_palace_mod: "Birthing the neo-Hefdarric style, Hartbaltt's Palace tries to imitate certain aspects of Hefdaric architecture while innovating with aspects of post-Hefdaric and even Dragkhanic. It's slightly fortified and it sits outside the city walls, looming over the capital as a symbol of the young King's power."
sorrborr_mod: "Sørrborr"
desc_sorrborr_mod: "Sørrborr is a title reserved for the very few cities in the Silver Dwarven world which achieve the status of a true Metropolis, housing grand projects, infrastructure, monuments, and trading centers."

me_srrorum_3_desc: "After weeks of negotiations and debates, the leaders of both parties have managed to find a compromise. The following series of laws, known to all as the 'Ubaturren ulfton Thorgarren', or Reforms of the Citizens, are passed:\n1 - Citizenship will be extended to all freemen regardless of prior military service.\n2 - The council, now called the 'Sørrhlturr', the Great Thing, will be split into two branches. The 'Ghlattanvindr', or Father House, will be made up of 15 members of the Great Merchant families just like during the times of the Thyrr Ubaturren, while the 'Arnnanvindr', or Son House, will be made up of 100 representatives elected by their fellow citizens. Election terms for the Ghlattanvindr will be 4 years while it will be every two years for the Arnnhtlurr.\n3 - The Hatamögg role will be elected from Ghlattanvindr every four years by the members of the Arnnanvindr and serve as the face of the republic in international affairs, commander in chief of the army, and ensure laws passed by the Sørrhlturr are enforced onto the nation.\n4 - The Ghlattanvindr will be in charge of commercial and military affairs while the Arnnanvindr will be in charge of civilian and naval affairs. Both can present possible legislation which can be vetoed by the other. The Ghlattanvindr requires a majority vote to pass legislation while the Arnnanvindr required 3/4ths agreement to pass legislation. Possible legislation must be passed by both houses to become law.\n\nHaving formed a new government, the first Sørrhlturr makes a unanimous decision. No longer are we a simple 'rum', as we are no longer waiting for a king to return. Our new republic, born from the unity of the Saptan people, will be called Srrøveldi, or the Silver Republic."

Weeks passed with no meaningful solutions or compromises passed until one shocking announcement changed the debates altogether. A pair of bright young Leslesi statesmen were adopted into the Segurrvelk family by an older retired merchant who had no heirs. The brothers, Vodenos and Cavarus, debated together with their new platform, their exemplary oratory skills making many old guard senators sympathetic towards Leslesi citizenship.\n\nFinally, after around a year of debates and legislation, the 'Janirr Thorgarren' Laws were finally passed by both houses, granting universal citizenship to all freemen of Leslesi descent as well as equal status and rights as Galmar dwarves."

srrorum.1.t: "The Return of the King"
srrorum.1.desc: "Three Hundred Years have passed since the fall of our kingdom, the end of our royal line, and the end of our golden age. Since then, the council of elders that ruled in their absence have been overthrown by the great merchant families of the city, who, through commerce and intrigue, wrested control of the city and its army from the former custodians of the throne. However, today a stranger has appeared before the three families, claiming the vacant throne.\n\nHe claims to be Krstoff Aspatta, a child descended from relatives of our final king who escaped during the Great Siege. However, this pretender has provided substantial documents to prove his claim, and is backed by an army of peasants from his homeland. The Kvaran and the Øtensonn, eager to use this young king to unseat the Segurrvelk, argue for his restoration. However, the Segurrvelk argue that the current rule of the families will be undermined by this stranger and urge the other two families to remember their coup of the previous oligarchy. While many members of the Kvaran and Øtensonn are swayed by the Segurrvelk's passionate orations, we must make a decision."
