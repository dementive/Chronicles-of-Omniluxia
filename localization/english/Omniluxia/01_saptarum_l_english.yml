03_saptarum: "The Ruined City"
03_saptarum_DESCRIPTION: "Nearly 400 years have passed since the sack of our great city by the #E Zani#! invaders. Since then, our nation has declined into a rump state deep in the mountains. While we may lament the loss of our past glory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] does possess certain advantages that will help it succeed on the international stage: a warrior culture and a strong merchant heritage.\n\nThe city currently finds itself as a #E plutocratic society#! dominated by a council of the #R Great Merchant Families#! of the city, the #E Kvaran#!, the #E Øtensonn#!, and the #E Segurrvelk#!. The #E Kvaran#! are the oldest and wealthiest family, and members are often very traditional in their beliefs. The #E Øtensonn#! claim to be descendants of the great hero #G Øten 'tö Hrungmögg'#!, and have a strong military tradition, with all male members expected to become a part of the aristocratic officers that run the military. Finally, the #E Segurrvelk#! are the youngest family, said to have been founded by commoners who managed to use their talents to achieve great wealth as merchants. They are the largest family and the most populist of all of the three.\n\nWhile the three families run the state, their rivalries have caused a rift that could be exploited by an outsider. While the #E Kvaran#! and the #E Øtensonn#! continue to uphold the tradition of acting as #Y 'Custodians of the Throne'#!, the #E Segurrvelk#! push for the abolition of the long-vacant throne. On top of political disagreements, the #E Kvaran#! and #E Øtensonn#! fear the power that the much larger #E Segurrvelk#! might use against them if the country was ever to enter another civil war.\n\n\nIn this environment, it will only take one event to trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that will once again change the trajectory of the #E Saptan#! people!\n"
03_saptarum_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has restored its place as one of the strongest powers in Morrigon!"

#Missions 

03_saptarum_task_1: "Expel the Families"
03_saptarum_task_1_DESC: "Having used the foolish Kvaran and Øtensonn against the Segurrvelk, the young king can now work on undermining the power of the remaining families.\n\nNow that the balance of power is gone, the Kvarans and Øtensonns are at each other's throats, and believe the King will be a useful tool they can use over the other. The King plays along and placates the families by removing their rivals from positions of power. However, he also quietly puts his supporters into these roles, until he has full control of the government and the army, and is able to expel the corrupt families."

03_saptarum_task_2: "Re-Establish the Forrj Guard"
03_saptarum_task_2_DESC: "With their dark red armor and bonesteel swords, the Forrj Guard was a legendary force that protected the Saptan Kingdom in its heyday. With the fall of its final commander, Øten 'tö Hrungmögg', and the kingdom itself the guard faded into legend. However, with the return of the Aspatta and the army reforms led by our new king, the time has come for the Forrj Guard to return as vanguards of the King's new royal army."

03_saptarum_task_3: "The Return of the Aspatta"
03_saptarum_task_3_DESC: "With the expulsion of the last remnants of the old families, new nobility have filled their place. To ensure the loyalty of these new men and the power of the monarchy, the King has decided to invest into the army to ensure his personal control over them and centralize his power."

03_saptarum_task_4: "Integrating Aspatabi"
03_saptarum_task_4_DESC: "A symbol of hope for our people, integrating the prosperous colony of Aspata will provide more men for our armies and land to tax. Both of which are important to our King's ambitions."

03_saptarum_task_5: "Liberate Our Allies"
03_saptarum_task_5_DESC: "Ever since the collapse of the Zani, the Saptans have maintained friendly relations and even alliances with the neighboring Borderlander Leslesi tribes, even buying some land from one of their chieftains where we founded the city of Aspata. However, while we were distracted by political squabbles, our allies were subjugated by other hostile Borderlander tribes and Orcish invaders. It's time to honor our longstanding friendship and liberate our age-old allies."

03_saptarum_task_6: "Drive Out the Orcs"
03_saptarum_task_6_DESC: "The Orcs are a relatively recent player in Northern Morrigon, and have been a consistent thorn in the side of all powers in that area. Starting in the 900s, Orcish invaders created colonies on the coast of the Orcish Sea after capturing important trade hubs such as what was formerly Gørhöffabi.\n\nA bellicose people, the Orcs have managed to become the dominant trading force in the Central Omniluxian sea by hooking potential customers to their 'products' and threatening other traders and nations with violence to eliminate the competition. It would benefit us to take over their trading hubs and end their dominion and presence on the continent."

03_saptarum_task_7: "Dominate the Orcish Sea Trade"
03_saptarum_task_7_DESC: "Now that we've removed our main competition, we should continue our expansion into the ports of the Celticans and the Borderlanders as well as develop our new conquests and harness the Orcish Sea Trade for our own benefit!"

03_saptarum_task_8: "Contesting the Nazani"
03_saptarum_task_8_DESC: "Using the newfound wealth of the Orcish Sea, our King can now turn his full attention to his ultimate ambition: the conquest of the Nazani Empire. Heirs of the Zani, the Nazani must be destroyed before Sapta is allowed to truly rise again. However, being such a large empire, we must first weaken them by conquering the wealthy cities of Northern Wegalia."

03_saptarum_task_9: "Conquer the Nazani"
03_saptarum_task_9_DESC: "With sharks circling around the weakened Nazani, we must strike first, lest outside powers intervene in our revenge!"

03_saptarum_task_10: "Punish the Heirs of the Zani"
03_saptarum_task_10_DESC: "Dwarves among all races are notorious for holding grudges, and no dwarves hold a greater grudge than the Galmar Silver Dwarves of Morrigon. With the fall of the Nazani and the capture of the ancient Zani city of Barramunatko Zani, the Galmar finally have their chance to take their revenge on the descendents of their conquerors."

03_saptarum_task_11: "The Forrj City"
03_saptarum_task_11_DESC: "There is a popular myth among those who dwell along the slopes of the Pjershyan Highlands, one of a bird as large as a dragon and unable to be killed. It is said in the Great Walk that the Galmar hunted this bird every day for a hundred years and its meat sustained them throughout their journey to the Sapta Valley. The elders say that once the bird's bones were symbolically burned in a cave, it would reappear from that cave the following morning.\n\nThis bird, the Forrj, is a symbol of our city. A city reborn through the flames of another. No longer the capital of a kingdom, but now the seat of an empire."

03_saptarum_task_12: "Rebuild Wegalia"
03_saptarum_task_12_DESC: "Once our bloodlust subsided, we can look with fresh eyes at the destruction we've brought to the children of the Zani. Ruined cities, families, villages, farms, we've become so blind with rage that we've burned everything in our path. As the fires turn to embers, it's time to help rebuild and resettle the former cities of the Zani in our image with the help of our Leslesi allies."


#REPUBLIC
03_saptarum_task_13: "Preserve the Council"
03_saptarum_task_13_DESC: "Having beaten the pretender, the merchant families of Saptarum gather and agree that change must occur to ensure that a threat like this can never arise again.\nFirst, family rivalries must end, and the council will be divided evenly between the three families, with each one receiving five seats on it for a total of fifteen council members. One of our members will be elected as the Hatamögg, or 'Speaker', for our council and be the face of our republic abroad. Secondly, the council passes civic reforms to restrict citizenship and therefore political power and education to the upper classes to ensure that the bureaucracy remains in their control. Finally, the council passes army reforms to allow only citizens into the army, cementing their control over the armed forces. Additionally, any freeman who serves in the military for more than 20 years will gain citizenship for them and their descendants.\nThe 'Thyrr Ubaturren', or 'Three Reforms', as they come to be known as, will be fundamental in ensuring stability in our new republic."
family_heads_greater_60_loyalty_tt: "#Y All family heads have#! #T 60 Loyalty#! #Y or greater#!."

03_saptarum_task_14: "Annex Aspatabi"
03_saptarum_task_14_DESC: "With our new army we are now able to impose our influence abroad and expand our influence and power. We should begin by finally annexing the only other Galmar city big enough to contest our strength, Aspatabi, bringing their resources and manpower into our growing republic."

03_saptarum_task_15: "Leslesi Auxiliaries"
03_saptarum_task_15_DESC: "Due to our shared hatred of the Zani, our people have often maintained strong relations with the various Leslesi tribes of the Northern Pjershyan Hills, which translated into trade agreements and military alliances that were disrupted during the chaos caused by our coup that removed the corrupt Council of Elders. During our internal conflicts, neighboring Borderlander tribes and Orcs subjugated our allies, and we failed to take any actions even after our council's ascension. The Leslesi are fierce warriors and loyal allies, freeing them from their oppressors and integrating them into our republic would be beneficial to us and our ambitions in the region."

03_saptarum_task_16: "Ports of the Orcish Sea"
03_saptarum_task_16_DESC: "Now that we've secured our borders and recruited our Leslesi allies, the council's next main objective is to expand their influence in the wealthy Orcish Sea trade. By capturing and developing key Orcish and Human ports, we can simultaneously eliminate our competition and create major economic centers to expand our influence abroad. \n\nAdditionally, captured Orcish trade vessels could prove useful for any future maritime ambitions…"

03_saptarum_task_17: "The Southern Borderlanders"
03_saptarum_task_17_DESC: "By integrating our Leslesi allies we have inherited their conflicts with the other major Borderlander tribes to our south. However, we can use this to our advantage and claim the resources of the southern Borderlanders for ourselves!"

03_saptarum_task_18: "A Merchant Fleet"
03_saptarum_task_18_DESC: "Using the knowledge we've gained from studying Orcish ships, we must innovate on their designs and construct a grand Merchant Fleet capable of protecting our trade interests against conniving Orcish and Human pirates and steering trade to our new ports!"

03_saptarum_task_19: "Leslesi Settlers"
03_saptarum_task_19_DESC: "Controlling such a large expanse of land is a costly endeavor, especially due to the hostile nature of the Borderlanders. However, our Leslesi allies provide us with a unique solution. By dispersing Leslesi settlements around the south, we can establish friendly trading posts who will ensure regional stability."

03_saptarum_task_20: "The Sørrsalla"
03_saptarum_task_20_DESC: "Our conquests have brought Saptabi and the council great wealth and splendors. To commemorate our successes and showcase the wealth and authority of the council and our realm, the Kvaran have patronized several upcoming artists and metalworkers to create the Sørrsalla, or Great Hall."

03_saptarum_task_21: "Skilled Artisans"
03_saptarum_task_21_DESC: "Back during the Saptan Golden Age, our people were known as some of the best metalworkers in all of Omniluxia, a reputation that would unfortunately attract unwanted attention. However, now that our republic is strong enough to protect itself, we should encourage and patronize the artisans of our realm to restore this ancient reputation!"

03_saptarum_task_22: "A Walled Metropolis"
03_saptarum_task_22_DESC: "Long ago we made the foolish mistake of thinking that our city's naturally defensible position would protect us from invaders, and our hubris led to our destruction. Now we face a new problem of overpopulation, as our ancient city cannot adequately house or sustain the influx of people that are migrating here.\n\nWith some careful planning, we are able to solve both problems. If we were to patronize artists and architects to rebuild our city, we would be able to create a new metropolis out of the embers of our old capital. Additionally, to protect our citizens and our new wealth, we must erect walls as tall as the Wall of God to surround our newly expanded city.\n\nWith these new improvements, our city can truly ascend to becoming one of the few Sørrborr, or 'Great Metropolis' of the Dwarven World!"

03_saptarum_task_23: "Rights of the Citizens"
03_saptarum_task_23_DESC: "While our republic has become very wealthy, that wealth has concentrated mainly amongst the powerful aristocratic nobles of the great merchant families. Unfortunately, this has caused quite a bit of unrest amongst the general population, with serfs and freemen demanding an expansion of citizenship while citizen soldiers demand better representation in our council. Our attempts to placate the masses with massive building projects have not seen the success we are hoping for, and we must acquiesce to some of their demands lest we succumb to ruinous riots and revolts."

03_saptarum_task_24: "The Forrj and the Wolf"
03_saptarum_task_24_DESC: "The Leslesi have proved to be resourceful and loyal allies, going from scattered communities to large urban centers of civilization. They've adopted many aspects of Galmar culture, with many even adopting the Hebric faith, putting their own heroes into our pantheon and their philosophers and theologians arguing whether Galmarr 'tö Vernun' and other Silver Dwarven heroes were reincarnations of Lula. Many of their brightest have become some of the most skilled traders and generals in our nation. However, they remain second class citizens to the Galmar, and very few Leslesi are actually allowed official citizenship. With the passing of the Ubaturren ulfton Thorgarren, this is now an issue which many Leslesi and Galmar alike have decided to change."

The 'Ghlattanvindr', or Father House, will be made up of 15 members of the Great Merchant families just like during the times of the Thyrr Ubaturren, while the 'Arnnanvindr', or Son House, will be made up of 100 representatives elected by their fellow citizens.
