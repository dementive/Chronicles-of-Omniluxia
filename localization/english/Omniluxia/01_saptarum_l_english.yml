03_saptarum: "The Ruined City"
03_saptarum_DESCRIPTION: "Nearly four hundred years have passed since the sack of our great city by the #E Zani#! invaders. Since then, our nation has declined into a rump state deep in the mountains. While we may lament the loss of our past glory, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] does possess certain advantages that will help it succeed on the international stage: a warrior culture and a strong merchant heritage.\n\nThe city currently finds itself as a #E plutocratic society#! dominated by a council of the #R Great Merchant Families#! of the city, the #E Kvaran#!, the #E Otensonn#!, and the #E Segurrvelk#!. The #E Kvaran#! are the oldest and wealthiest family, and members are often very traditional in their beliefs. The #E Otensonn#! claim to be descendants of the great hero #G Oten 'to Hrungmogg'#!, and have a strong military tradition, with all male members expected to become a part of the aristocratic officers that run the military. Finally, the #E Segurrvelk#! are the youngest family, said to have been founded by commoners who managed to use their talents to achieve great wealth as merchants. They are the largest family and the most populist of all of the three.\n\nWhile the three families run the state, their rivalries have caused a rift that could be exploited by an outsider. While the #E Kvaran#! and the #E Otensonn#! continue to uphold the tradition of acting as #Y 'Custodians of the Throne'#!, the #E Segurrvelk#! push for the abolition of the long-vacant throne. On top of political disagreements, the #E Kvaran#! and #E Otensonn#! fear the power that the much larger #E Segurrvelk#! might use against them if the country was ever to enter another civil war.\n\n\nIn this environment, it will only take one event to trigger a catastrophic chain reaction that will once again change the trajectory of the #E Saptan#! people!\n"
03_saptarum_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has restored its place as one of the strongest powers in Morrigon!"

#Missions 

03_saptarum_task_1: "Expel the Families"
03_saptarum_task_1_DESC: "Having used the foolish #E Kvaran#! and #E Otensonn#! against the #E Segurrvelk#!, the young king can now work on undermining the power of the remaining families.\n\nNow that the balance of power is gone, the #E Kvaran#! and #E Otensonn#! are at each other's throats, and believe the King will be a useful tool they can use over the other. With this knowledge in mind, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] plays along and placates the families by removing their rivals from positions of power. However, he quietly plots to put his supporters into these roles, until he has full control of the government and the army, and is able to expel the corrupt families."

03_saptarum_task_2: "Re-Establish the Forrj Guard"
03_saptarum_task_2_DESC: "With their dark red armor and Bonesteel swords, the #R Forrj Guard#! was a legendary force that protected the #E Saptan Kingdom#! in its heyday. With the fall of its final commander, #E Oten 'to Hrungmogg'#!, and the kingdom itself the guard faded into legend. However, with the return of the #E Aspatta#! and the army reforms led by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the time has come for the #R Forrj Guard#! to return as vanguards of the King's new royal army."

03_saptarum_task_3: "The Return of the Aspatta"
03_saptarum_task_3_DESC: "With the expulsion of the last remnants of the old families, new nobility have filled their place. With the wealth he's seized from the former families, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has decided to invest into his army, both to ensure his personal control over his soldiers and to centralize his power over the kingdom."

03_saptarum_task_4: "Integrating Aspatabi"
03_saptarum_task_4_DESC: "A symbol of hope for our people, integrating the prosperous colony of [GetCountry('SV4').GetName] will provide more men for our armies and land to tax. Their annexation will be [GetCountry('SV2').GetName]'s first step to empire."

03_saptarum_task_5: "Liberate Our Allies"
03_saptarum_task_5_DESC: "Ever since the collapse of the #E Zani#!, the Saptans have maintained friendly relations and even alliances with the neighboring Borderlander #E Leslesi#! tribes, with Aspatabi being founded on land purchased from #E Leslesi#! chieftains. However, while we were distracted by political squabbles, our allies were subjugated by other #R hostile Borderlander tribes#! and #R Orcish invaders#!. It's time to honor our longstanding friendship and liberate the #E Leslesi#!!"

03_saptarum_task_6: "Drive Out the Orcs"
03_saptarum_task_6_DESC: "The #E #R Acliuram Orcs#!#! are relatively recent players in #E Northern Morrigon#!, and have been a rising threat to all powers in the area.\n\nArriving around two hundred years ago, these #R Orcish invaders#! created colonies on the coast of the #E Orcish Sea#! surrounding the major trade hubs they conquered, such as #E Gorhoffabi#!.\n\nA bellicose people, the #R Orcs#! have managed to become the dominant trading force in the #E Orcish Sea#! by hooking potential customers to their 'products' and threatening other traders and nations with violence to eliminate the competition. It would benefit us to take over their trading hubs and end their tyranny for good."

03_saptarum_task_7: "Consolidate the South"
03_saptarum_task_7_DESC: "As the #E #R Orcs#!#! are being dealt with, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] turns his attention to the various hostile #E Celtican#! and #E Borderlander#! tribes that occupy the many inland and coastal trading hubs of #E Northern Morrigon#!. Conquering their wealthy cities will bring us one step closer to dominating the #E Orcish Sea#! Trade!"

03_saptarum_task_8: "Dominate the Orcish Sea Trade"
03_saptarum_task_8_DESC: "With both the #E #R Orcs#!#! and #E Humans#! subjugated, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can finally begin consolidating his dominion over the #E Orcish Sea#! Trade! Developing the various trade hubs he's conquered, the wealth that will flow into his Kingdom from this endeavor would be able to fund his future campaigns against the hated [GetCountry('WGA').GetName]!"

03_saptarum_task_9: "Contesting the Nazani"
03_saptarum_task_9_DESC: "Using the newfound wealth of the #E Orcish Sea#!, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] can now turn his full attention to his ultimate ambition: the conquest and destruction of the [GetCountry('WGA').GetName]. Heirs of the cruel #E Zani#!, the [GetCountry('WGA').GetName] must be utterly destroyed before [GetCountry('SV2').GetName] can truly rise again.\n\nHowever, such a stable and wealthy empire will be difficult to subjugate, so [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s armies must first weaken them by plundering the wealthy cities of the #E Ularians#!."

03_saptarum_task_10: "Conquer the Nazani"  
03_saptarum_task_10_DESC: "With other empires greedily eyeing up the weakened [GetCountry('WGA').GetName], we must strike quickly to ensure our dominion over our hated enemies! Let us not allow them to escape judgement!"

03_saptarum_task_11: "Punish the Heirs of the Zani"
03_saptarum_task_11_DESC: "#E Dwarves#! among all races are notorious for holding grudges, and no dwarves hold a greater grudge than the #E Galmar Silver Dwarves of Morrigon#! have against the #E #R Weagelians#!#!. With the fall of the [GetCountry('WGA').GetName] and the capture of the ancient #E #R Zani#!#! city of [GetProvince('(int32)2720').GetName], the #E Galmar#! finally have their chance to take their revenge on the descendents of their conquerors."

03_saptarum_task_12: "The Forrj City"
03_saptarum_task_12_DESC: "There is a popular myth among those who dwell along the slopes of the #E Pjershyan Highlands#!, one of a bird as large as a dragon and unable to be killed. It is said in the #E Sorrgann#!, or #E Great Walk#!, that the #E Galmar#! hunted this bird every day for a hundred years, with its meat sustaining them throughout their journey to the #E Saptan Valley#!. The elders say that once the bird's bones were symbolically burned in a cave, it would reappear from the mountains the following morning.\n\nThis bird, the #E #R Forrj#!#!, is a symbol of our city. A city reborn through the flames that incinerate others. A city that is no longer the capital of a kingdom, but now the seat of an empire."

03_saptarum_task_13: "Rebuild Wegalia"
03_saptarum_task_13_DESC: "With our bloodlust subsiding, our people look with fresh eyes at the destruction we've brought to the children of the #E #R Zani#!#!. Ruined cities, families, villages, farms, we've become so blind with rage that we've burned everything in our path. As the fires turn to embers, it's time to help rebuild and resettle the former cities of the #E #R Zani#!#! in our image with the help of our #E #G Leslesi#!#! allies."


#REPUBLIC
03_saptarum_task_14: "Preserve the Council"
03_saptarum_task_14_DESC: "Having beaten the pretender, the merchant families of Saptarum gather and agree that change must occur to ensure that a threat like this can never arise again.\nFirst, family rivalries must end, and the council will be divided evenly between the three families, with each one receiving five seats on it for a total of fifteen council members. One of our members will be elected as the Hatamogg, or 'Speaker', for our council and be the face of our Republic abroad. Secondly, the council passes civic reforms to restrict citizenship and therefore political power and education to the upper classes to ensure that the bureaucracy remains in their control. Finally, the council passes army reforms to allow only citizens into the army, cementing their control over the armed forces. Additionally, any freeman who serves in the military for more than twenty years will gain citizenship for them and their descendants.\nThe 'Thyrr Ubaturren', or 'Three Reforms', as they come to be known as, will be fundamental in ensuring stability in our new Republic."
family_heads_greater_60_loyalty_tt: "#Y All family heads have#! #T 60 Loyalty#! #Y or greater#!."

03_saptarum_task_15: "Annex Aspatabi"
03_saptarum_task_15_DESC: "With our new army we are now able to impose our influence abroad and expand our influence and power. We should begin by finally annexing the only other Galmar city big enough to contest our strength, Aspatabi, bringing their resources and manpower into our growing Republic."

03_saptarum_task_16: "Leslesi Auxiliaries"
03_saptarum_task_16_DESC: "Due to our shared hatred of the Zani, our people have often maintained strong relations with the various Leslesi tribes of the Northern Pjershyan Hills, which translated into trade agreements and military alliances that were disrupted during the chaos caused by our coup that removed the corrupt Council of Elders. During our internal conflicts, neighboring Borderlander tribes and Orcs subjugated our allies, and we failed to take any actions even after our council's ascension. The Leslesi are fierce warriors and loyal allies, freeing them from their oppressors and integrating them into our Republic would be beneficial to us and our ambitions in the region."

03_saptarum_task_17: "Ports of the Orcish Sea"
03_saptarum_task_17_DESC: "Now that we've secured our borders and recruited our Leslesi allies, the council's next main objective is to expand their influence in the wealthy Orcish Sea trade. By capturing and developing key Orcish and Human ports, we can simultaneously eliminate our competition and create major economic centers to expand our influence abroad. \n\nAdditionally, captured Orcish trade vessels could prove useful for any future maritime ambitions…"

03_saptarum_task_18: "The Southern Borderlanders"
03_saptarum_task_18_DESC: "By integrating our Leslesi allies we have inherited their conflicts with the other major Borderlander tribes to our south. However, we can use this to our advantage and claim the resources of the southern Borderlanders for ourselves!"

03_saptarum_task_19: "A Merchant Fleet"
03_saptarum_task_19_DESC: "Using the knowledge we've gained from studying Orcish ships, we must innovate on their designs and construct a grand Merchant Fleet capable of protecting our trade interests against conniving Orcish and Human pirates and steering trade to our new ports!"

03_saptarum_task_20: "Leslesi Settlers"
03_saptarum_task_20_DESC: "Controlling such a large expanse of land is a costly endeavor, especially due to the hostile nature of the Borderlanders. However, our Leslesi allies provide us with a unique solution. By dispersing Leslesi settlements around the south, we can establish friendly trading posts who will ensure regional stability."

03_saptarum_task_21: "The Sorrsalla"
03_saptarum_task_21_DESC: "Our conquests have brought Saptabi and the council great wealth and splendors. To commemorate our successes and showcase the wealth and authority of the council and our realm, the Kvaran have patronized several upcoming artists and metalworkers to create the Sorrsalla, or Great Hall."

03_saptarum_task_22: "Skilled Artisans"
03_saptarum_task_22_DESC: "Back during the Saptan Golden Age, our people were known as some of the best metalworkers in all of Omniluxia; a reputation that would unfortunately attract unwanted attention. However, now that our Republic is strong enough to protect itself, we should encourage and patronize the artisans of our realm to restore this ancient reputation!"

03_saptarum_task_23: "A Walled Metropolis"
03_saptarum_task_23_DESC: "Long ago, we made the foolish mistake of thinking that our city's naturally defensible position would protect us from invaders, and our hubris led to our destruction. Now we face a new problem of overpopulation, as our ancient city cannot adequately house or sustain the influx of people that are migrating here.\n\nWith some careful planning, we are able to solve both problems. If we were to patronize artists and architects to rebuild our city, we would be able to create a new metropolis out of the embers of our old capital. Additionally, to protect our citizens and our new wealth, we must erect walls as tall as the Wall of God to surround our newly expanded city.\n\nWith these new improvements, our city can truly ascend to becoming one of the few Sorrborr, or 'Great Metropolis' of the Dwarven World!"

03_saptarum_task_24: "Rights of the Citizens"
03_saptarum_task_24_DESC: "While our Republic has become very wealthy, that wealth has concentrated mainly amongst the powerful aristocratic nobles of the great merchant families. Unfortunately, this has caused quite a bit of unrest amongst the general population, with serfs and freemen demanding an expansion of citizenship while citizen soldiers demand better representation in our council. Our attempts to placate the masses with massive building projects have not seen the success we are hoping for, and we must acquiesce to some of their demands lest we succumb to ruinous riots and revolts."

03_saptarum_task_25: "The Forrj and the Wolf"
03_saptarum_task_25_DESC: "The Leslesi have proved to be resourceful and loyal allies, going from scattered communities to large urban centers of civilization. They've adopted many aspects of Galmar culture, with many even adopting the Hebric faith, putting their own heroes into our pantheon and their philosophers and theologians arguing whether Galmarr 'to Vernun' and other Silver Dwarven heroes were reincarnations of Lula. Many of their brightest have become some of the most skilled traders and generals in our nation. However, they remain second class citizens to the Galmar, and very few Leslesi are actually allowed official citizenship. With the passing of the Ubaturren ulfton Thorgarren, this is now an issue which many Leslesi and Galmar alike have decided to change."

#me_saptarum_3_desc: "After weeks of negotiations and debates, the leaders of both parties have managed to find a compromise. The following series of laws, known to all as the 'Ubaturren ulfton Thorgarren', or Reforms of the Citizens, are passed:\n1 - Citizenship will be extended to all freemen regardless of prior military service.\n2 - The council, now called the 'Sorrhlturr', the Great Thing, will be split into two branches. The 'Ghlattanvindr', or Father House, will be made up of 15 members of the Great Merchant families just like during the times of the Thyrr Ubaturren, while the 'Arnnanvindr', or Son House, will be made up of 100 representatives elected by their fellow citizens. Election terms for the Ghlattanvindr will be 4 years while it will be every two years for the Arnnhtlurr.\n3 - The Hatamogg role will be elected from Ghlattanvindr every four years by the members of the Arnnanvindr and serve as the face of the republic in international affairs, commander in chief of the army, and ensure laws passed by the Sorrhlturr are enforced onto the nation.\n4 - The Ghlattanvindr will be in charge of commercial and military affairs while the Arnnanvindr will be in charge of civilian and naval affairs. Both can present possible legislation which can be vetoed by the other. The Ghlattanvindr requires a majority vote to pass legislation while the Arnnanvindr required 3/4ths agreement to pass legislation. Possible legislation must be passed by both houses to become law.\n\nHaving formed a new government, the first Sorrhlturr makes a unanimous decision. No longer are we a simple 'rum', as we are no longer waiting for a king to return. Our new republic, born from the unity of the Saptan people, will be called Srroveldi, or the Silver Republic."

Weeks passed with no meaningful solutions or compromises passed until one shocking announcement changed the debates altogether. A pair of bright young Leslesi statesmen were adopted into the Segurrvelk family by an older retired merchant who had no heirs. The brothers, Vodenos and Cavarus, debated together with their new platform, their exemplary oratory skills making many old guard senators sympathetic towards Leslesi citizenship.\n\nFinally, after around a year of debates and legislation, the 'Janirr Thorgarren' Laws were finally passed by both houses, granting universal citizenship to all freemen of Leslesi descent as well as equal status and rights as Galmar dwarves."

saptarum.1.t: "The Return of the King"
saptarum.1.desc: "Three Hundred Years have passed since the fall of our kingdom, the end of our royal line, and the end of our golden age. Since then, the #E Council of Elders#! that ruled in their absence have been overthrown by the #E Great Merchant Families#! of the city, who, through commerce and intrigue, wrested control of the city and its army from the former custodians of the throne. However, today a stranger has appeared before the three families, claiming the vacant throne.\n\nHe claims to be [GetCharacter('(int32)90').GetName], a child descended from relatives of our final king, #E Inarr Aspatta#!, who escaped during the #R Great Siege#!. However, this pretender has provided substantial documents to prove his claim, and is backed by an army of peasants from his home territory. The #E Kvaran#! and the #E Otensonn#!, eager to use this young king to unseat the more populist #E Segurrvelk#!, argue for his restoration. However, the #E Segurrvelk#! counter with the threat he poses to the current rule of the families, and urge the other two families to remember their own coup of the previous oligarchy. While many members of the #E Kvaran#! and #E Otensonn#! are swayed by the #E Segurrvelk#!'s passionate orations, they must make a decision."

saptarum.2.t: "A Union of Two Peoples"
saptarum.2.desc: "Due to silver dwarven society's emphasis on family and community, having a child with an outsider has traditionally been considered taboo. However, due to the new liberal marriage laws and the close relationship between our communities, there has been a growing number of mixed Leslesi and Silver Dwarven couples. While relationships between silver dwarves and humans have occurred before, they were typically isolated incidents and have never been as prevalent as it is now. The sheer quantity of new mixed race couples has led to the creation of 'Halflings', or 'Itllmurren' as the elders call them, appearing in major cities. They have proved themselves to be a sturdy people, and have inherited the best traits of both races. However, the appearance of these 'Halflings' puts us in a unique position."
