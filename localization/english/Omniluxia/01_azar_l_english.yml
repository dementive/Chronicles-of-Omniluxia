03_azar: "Return of the Golden Dwarves"
03_azar_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] ruled over an expansive kingdom that ran along the impassable mountains to the north. From the grand city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], home of the famed #E Great Ziggurat#!, #E Etemenazari#!, that was the center of their way of life, they challenged the might of the northerners while keeping the steppe riders at bay.\n\nBut one day, in what has become known as #E The Betrayal at Ruzel#!, a traitorous vassal allowed the armies of the #E Zani Empire#! to travel through their lands without offering any warning to the Azari, who were caught unawares and suffered a calamitous defeat. After a siege that lasted nearly ten years, the exhausted Azari defenders could resist no longer and the Zani destroyed their city and the Ziggurat, tearing it down to its foundation and enslaving the Golden Dwarves.\n\nIn the following decades, the Zani Imperial Armies abandoned this region as their generals fought amongst each other, and the Golden Dwarves repaired the walls of Tiuban. After the Great Collapse, the Azari survived and soldiered on, slowly rebuilding their broken civilization but never reclaiming the glory that they once knew."
03_azar_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has conquered the neighboring countries that once paid tribute to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], rebuilt the #E Great Ziggurat#!, #E Etemenazari#!, and reformed the #E Mâkdid Sho-Tan Azarî#! - the Golden Kingdom."
