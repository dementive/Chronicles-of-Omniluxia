03_azar: "Return of the Golden Dwarves"
03_azar_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] ruled over an expansive kingdom that ran along the impassable mountains to the north. From the grand city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], home of the famed #E Great Ziggurat#!, #E Etemenazari#!, that was the center of their way of life, they challenged the might of the northerners while keeping the steppe riders at bay.\n\nBut one day, in what has become known as #E The Betrayal at Ruzel#!, a traitorous general allowed the armies of the #E Zani Empire#! to camp before the walls of Tiuban without resistance, and after a great siege that lasted almost ten years, the exhausted Azar defenders collapsed and the Zani destroyed the Ziggurat, tearing it down to its foundation.\n\nThe Zani civil wars caused the Imperials to ignore this region as they fought amongst each other, and in the years before and after the Great Collapse, the Azar slowly rebuilt, but were never able to reclaim the glory that they once knew."
03_azar_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has conquered the many #E Golden Dwarven#! countries that once paid tribute to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] in order to form a new kingdom."
