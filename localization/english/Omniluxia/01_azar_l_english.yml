03_azar: "Return of the Golden Dwarves"
03_azar_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] ruled over an expansive kingdom that ran along the impassable mountains to the north, and from the grand city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], home to the famed #E Great Ziggurat#! that was the center of their way of life, they challenged the might of the northerners while keeping the steppe riders at bay.\n\nBut one day, in what has become known as #E The Betrayal at Ruzel#!, a traitorous general allowed the armies of the #E Zani Empire#! to camp before the walls of Tiuban without resistance, and after a great siege that lasted almost ten years, the exhausted Azar defenders collapsed and the Zani destroyed the Ziggurat, tearing it down to its foundation.\n\nThe Zani civil wars caused the Imperials to ignore this region as they fought amongst each other, and in the years before and after the Great Collapse, the Azar slowly rebuilt, but were never able to reclaim the glory that they once knew."
03_azar_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has conquered the many #E Golden Dwarven#! countries that once paid tribute to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] in order to form a new kingdom."

03_azar_task_2_DESC: "Now that the gleaming #T Great Ziggurat of Tiuban#! towers above the city skyline once again, we must turn our attention to the rest of our ancestor's legacy. The canals that they built throughout the capital are impressive, but we should do what we can to expand them."

03_azar_task_3_DESC: "Every morning at dawn, our ancestors would greet the Solar Disc with sacrifices that ensured their protection for the inhabitants of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] and the people of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] in general.

03_azar_task_6_DESC: "With the rebellious western cities returned to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], we must contend with a powerful Dunydurceg nation that has taken over many of the southern regions that we once ruled - the [GetCountry('KAF').GetName].\n\nYet there are many Dwarves that would answer the call for battle, especially if it meant avenging our ancestors. The #E Bal-beni#! warriors on the other side of the mountains would send their sons to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] if there was a chance to burn [GetCountry('KAF').GetCapital.GetName]!"

When they finally completed this holy work, their faces were streaked with tears and prayers were upon their lips as they stood in the shadows of the grand structure towering above them."

Even now, their ancestors rule over what is rightful Azar clay; [GetCountry('LRS').GetRuler.GetName] has long been a thorn in the side of our people.\n\nBy abandoning their oaths of brotherhood, [GetCountry('LRS').GetName] became an independent nation and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] was doomed to fall to the Zani forces - a crime that must be avenged.

The promise of the plunder to be taken is too good, and thousands of men are ready to risk their lives for the prizes up for grabs.
