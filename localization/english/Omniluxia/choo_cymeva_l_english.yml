 03_cymeva: "The High Elves of Cymeva"
 03_cymeva_DESCRIPTION: "Following the deaths of both #E Calidriel#! and #E Cymeva#!, the #E High Elven#! kingdoms of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [GetCountry('ATH').GetName] coexisted in accordance with the #E #G Great High Elven Peace#!#!.\n\nThe Cymevans under [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] have used the last two hundred years of peace to settle parts of #E Northern Eptelon#! as well as send out #E #R Slaver Ships#!#! to raid the coasts of #E Arteon#! and #E Eptelon#!. Focusing on rebuilding their economy, forming a professional standing army of elite soldiers, and accruing slaves to do the menial labor so that elven men may join the army, the Cymevans are prepared to finally challenge [GetCharacter('(int32)33').GetName] for control of #E Horteon#!!"
 03_cymeva_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has united the #E High Elves#! of #E Horteon#!."
 03_cymeva_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "We will unite the High Elves under our rule!"

 03_cymeva_task_1: "A National Spirit"
 03_cymeva_task_1_DESC: "Even after the #E #R Great High Elven Civil War#!#! our people considered themselves culturally connected to those in the west. We were all #E High Elves#! descended from the sons of #E #R Atheus the Conquerer#!#!! However, centuries of division and isolation has created a unique identity in the more cosmopolitan elves that population the #E Cymevan#! realm, and it is time to decide if this new culture truly defines who we are."
 
 03_cymeva_task_2: "Vaur-Ac Warriors"
 03_cymeva_task_2_DESC: "Traditional elven warriors fight in half-plated steel armor, either accompanied with a longbow or with a #E Trac#!, called a 'Glaive' by the #E Horteonians#!. Under [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] we have established a professional army, so now it is imperative that we select the best of the best to form an elite unite of warriors to serve as shock infantry for the battles to come: the #E Vaur-Ac Warriors#!."

 03_cymeva_task_3: "Hua-roc Auxiliaries"
 03_cymeva_task_3_DESC: "The backbone of our society and our armies, the #E Hua-roc#! are the various slave peoples who work our estates and serve as light infantry meant to wear down our enemies. Due to our lack of manpower, it might be a good idea to employ they slave-soldiers to assist our more disciplined #E Elven#! regiments."

 03_cymeva_task_4: "Ending the Peace"
 03_cymeva_task_4_DESC: "The #E High Elven Peace#! has lasted ever since the death of the two kings that started the #E #R Great High Elven Civil War#!#!, however, it did not determine a decisive victor. With manpower from our colonies supporting our standing army, we can finally continue the #E #R Great Elven Civil War#!#! and firmly declare ourselves the victors!"

 03_cymeva_task_5: "Unite the High Elves"
 03_cymeva_task_5_DESC: "With the #E Atheusians#! defeated, we can finally claim complete control over the entire #E High Elven Realm of Horteon#!, one of the greatest powers in the history of #E Omniluxia#!!"

 03_cymeva_task_6: "Develop the Slave Estates"
 03_cymeva_task_6_DESC: "While we are lucky enough to hold the most fertile areas of #E Horteon#!, our lack of men means that we do not have enough to work our vast fields, nor does our noble nature entice us to do such menial labor. By creating large slave estates worked by the #E Hua-roc#! we can focus on more important and sophisticated crafts."

 03_cymeva_task_7: "The Pearl of Horteon"
 03_cymeva_task_7_DESC: "The #E Pearl of Horteon#!, [GetProvince('(int32)142').GetName|Y], is known across the #E Herpolian#! and #E Arteptolian#! seas for producing the finest pearls in #E Omniluxia#!. Local pearl divers and jewelers are some of the best in their craft, and should we help develop their city their exports would be unmatched!"

 03_cymeva_task_8: "The First City"
 03_cymeva_task_8_DESC: "[GetProvince('(int32)142').GetName|Y], or the '#E First City#!', is known as the first #E High Elven#! city founded by #E Atheus the Conquerer#! himself! Despite the official capital of the empire moving to [GetProvince('(int32)142').GetName|Y], our city has remained an important religious and cultural center for our people.\n\nLet us rebuild the great #E First City of Atheus#! into a cultural hub of the #E High Elven#! people!"

 03_cymeva_task_9: "Raise the Great Slaver Navy"
 03_cymeva_task_9_DESC: "After the end of the #E High Elven Civil War#! what was once the #E Great Slaver Navy#! was split between the two #E Elfrealms#! and underfunded. While we've made an effort to rebuild it, recent colonizations and skirmishes with the [GetCountry('ATH').GetName] have meant that our navy has taken a backseat to the development of our army.\n\nNow is the time to rebuild #E Atheus#!' great fleet, and look beyong the #E Herpolian Sea#!!"

 03_cymeva_task_10: "Controlling the Colonies"
 03_cymeva_task_10_DESC: "Our #E Eptelonian#! colonies have long chafed under our rule, believing themselves to know better than the rightful descendents of #E Atheus the Conquerer#!. Skirmishes with the [GetCountry('ATH').GetName] and the neglect of our navy has given the colonies relative autonomy, with the upstart [GetCountry('HE3').GetName] even breaking their ties with us.\n\nIt is time to take direct control over our unruly subjects and show the north who the true rulers of #E Eptelon#! are!"

 03_cymeva_task_11: "Dominate Eptelon"
 03_cymeva_task_11_DESC: "With our colonies firmly under our control, all that's left is to subjugate the various divided #E Eptelonian#! tribes. We shall dominate the continent that refused to bow to #E Atheus the Conquerer#!!"

 03_cymeva_task_12: "Fortify the East"
 03_cymeva_task_12_DESC: "While we struggle to defeat the [GetCountry('ATH').GetName], it is important not to forget the various #E Horteonian#! tribes to our north and east. Divided they are weak, however if they were to attack simultaneously it would be a disaster not seen since the #E Fourth Atheusian-Horteonian Wars#!! We must make sure that our border is well-defended to prevent such attacks."

 03_cymeva_task_13: "Pacify the North"
 03_cymeva_task_13_DESC: "With our border secured, the time has come to finally subjugate the last free #E Horteonians#! of the north! Let us finally unite the #E Land of Fire and Ice#! under our rule!"

 03_cymeva_task_14: "An Eastern Capital"
 03_cymeva_task_14_DESC: "The dreaded city of [GetProvince('(int32)264').GetName|Y] has stood as a symbol of #E Horteonian#! resistance since the #E Fourth Atheusian-Horteonian Wars#!, mocking our race with its longevity. However, with the #E Horteonians#! defeated and the city under our control, it is pertinent that we convert this symbol of resistance into one of submission to our rule. The #E Bulwark of Horteon#! will become our new #E Eastern Capital#!!"

  me_cymeva_1_desc: "Centuries have passed since our people could consider themselves part of a whole #E Atheusian#! realm. While #E High Elves#! live long lives, very few if any remain that can still recall the days of the united #E High Order#!.\n\nIn that time, our people have become more urban, cosmopolitan, and belligerent than our rural western 'brothers'. With war looming on the horizon, many wonder if we should continue to claim the legacy of #E #R Atheus the Conquerer#!#! or promote our local culture as sons of #E Cymeva#!."

  me_cymeva_2_desc: "For close to five centuries our people have been divided between the two #E Elfrealms#! of #E Horteon#!, stifling our growth and costing us our empire.\n\nNo longer shall we accept this status quo!\n\nMessengers have already been sent to the colonies, calling for additional manpower to bolster our forces. Our #E Horteonian#! subjects as recruited to serve as scouts and auxiliaries. Our armies now march with purpose towards [GetProvince('(int32)142').GetName|Y], seeking to fulfill [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName]'s dream to restore the #E High Order#! and the #E Ascendic Empire#! under our rightful rule, as the true successors of #E Atheus the Conquerer#!!"

Their troops are trained as professional soldiers much like in the days of #E Atheus the Great#!, but what we lack in quality we more than make up in quantity.\n\nShould we defeat the #E Cymevans#!, there is hope that we could unite the #E Elfrealms#! of the north under our banner, and finally honor the legacy of #E Atheus#!!"
  me_cymeva_3.a: "Rally the troops in the name of Atheus!"

He demands men and gold for his war to unite the #E Elfrealms#! of #E Horteon#! under his banner!\n\nObviously our men are eager to serve alongside their countrymen in #E Horteon#!, and I have no doubts of your loyalty to [GetProvince('(int32)345').GetName|Y], but there have been murmurs of dissent coming from both the government and the people.\n\nSpeculations that the #E Cymevans#! see us nothing more as extra manpower have begun circulating, and there are those that would prefer to see our overlord punished rather than succeed.\n\nOf course, the loyalty of the men and of the people is to you, my King. We shall follow you to the battlefield, whether it be against or for the #E Cymevans#!."

  me_cymeva_5_desc: "[GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName], terrible news from the colonies! It seems that COLONY NAME has not headed our call for men, and has instead risen against us!\n\nWhile crushing their small army would not be a troubling affair, our current campaign against [GetCountry('ATH').GetName] means that we cannot afford to stretch our forces too thin!\n\nGreat King, I know your wisdom will see us through this turmoil. Should we win this war quickly, the traitors shall be punished!"
  me_cymeva_5.a: "They dare rise up against me?"

  me_cymeva_6_title: "The High Elven Civil War Continues"
  me_cymeva_6_desc: "Great King, word has reached us from the far lands of #E Horteon#!! Little information reaches us from this distant land, the extent of our knowledge tells us that it is a cold land with a few human tribes dominated by the two great #E Elfrealms#! of the #E High Elves#! that have lived in peace far longer than we can remember.\n\nDespite this knowledge, word has arrived that the two realms now fight for control over the #E Land of Fire and Ice#! in a bitter struggle that will see only one victor."
  me_cymeva_6.a: "Those pointy-eared snobs are still fighting?"

Word comes from the dreaded #E Elfrealms#! of the south.\n\nMerchants and travelers have been spreading the news that the #E #R Great Elven Civil War#!#! has continued, and that the #E Elfrealms#! once again face each other on the battlefield.\n\nThe last time they were at odds our people were too disorganized and disheartened to fight, however we have no such luxury now! They have encroached on our territory and taken our people to serve then as slaves. Every opportunity that we don't take now is a chance missed to retake our homeland.\n\nNow seems like an excellent time to strike, if we are able to rally our tribesmen against the #E High Elves#!, we might yet still have a chance at freeing #E Horteon#!!"
