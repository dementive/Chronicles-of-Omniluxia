 03_cymeva: "The High Elves of Cymeva"
 03_cymeva_DESCRIPTION: "Following the deaths of both #E Calidriel#! and #E Cymeva#!, the #E High Elven#! kingdoms of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [GetCountry('ATH').GetName] coexisted in accordance with the #E #G Great High Elven Peace#!#!.\n\nThe Cymevans under [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] have used the last two hundred years of peace to settle parts of #E Northern Eptelon#! as well as send out #E #R Slaver Ships#!#! to raid the coasts of #E Arteon#! and #E Eptelon#!. Focusing on rebuilding their economy, forming a professional standing army of elite soldiers, and accruing slaves to do the menial labor so that elven men may join the army, the Cymevans are prepared to finally challenge [GetCharacter('(int32)33').GetName] for control of #E Horteon#!!"
 03_cymeva_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has united the #E High Elves#! of #E Horteon#!."
 03_cymeva_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "We will unite the High Elves under our rule!"

 03_cymeva_task_1: "A National Spirit"
 03_cymeva_task_1_DESC: "Even after the #E #R Great High Elven Civil War#!#! our people considered themselves culturally connected to those in the west. We were all #E High Elves#! descended from the sons of #E #R Atheus the Conquerer#!#!! However, centuries of division and isolation has created a unique identity in the more cosmopolitan elves that population the #E Cymevan#! realm, and it is time to decide if this new culture truly defines who we are."
 
 03_cymeva_task_2: "Vaur-Ac Warriors"
 03_cymeva_task_2_DESC: "Traditional elven warriors fight in half-plated steel armor, either accompanied with a longbow or with a #E Trac#!, called a 'Glaive' by the #E Horteonians#!. Under [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] we have established a professional army, so now it is imperative that we select the best of the best to form an elite unite of warriors to serve as shock infantry for the battles to come: the #E Vaur-Ac Warriors#!."

 03_cymeva_task_3: "Ending the Peace"
 03_cymeva_task_3_DESC: "The #E High Elven Peace#! has lasted ever since the death of the two kings that started the #E #R Great High Elven Civil War#!#!, however, it did not determine a decisive victor. With manpower from our colonies supporting our standing army, we can finally continue the #E #R Great Elven Civil War#!#! and firmly declare ourselves the victors!"

 03_cymeva_task_4: "Unite the High Elves"
 03_cymeva_task_4_DESC: "With the #E Atheusians#! defeated, we can finally claim complete control over the entire #E High Elven Realm of Horteon#!, one of the greatest powers in the history of #E Omniluxia#!!"





### EVENTS
  me_cymeva_1_title: "Sons of Cymeva"
  me_cymeva_1_desc: "Centuries have passed since our people could consider themselves part of a whole #E Atheusian#! realm. While #E High Elves#! live long lives, very few if any remain that can still recall the days of the united #E High Order#!.\n\nIn that time, our people have become more urban, cosmopolitan, and belligerent than our rural western 'brothers'. With war looming on the horizon, many wonder if we should continue to claim the legacy of #E #R Atheus the Conquerer#!#! or promote our local culture as sons of #E Cymeva#!."
  me_cymeva_1.a: "We are Atheusians!"
  me_cymeva_1_tooltip.a: "#T [GetCountry('ACY').GetName] will uphold the #E Atheusian#! culure#!"
  me_cymeva_1.b: "We are Cymevans!"
  me_cymeva_1_tooltip.b: "#T [GetCountry('ACY').GetName] will embrace their unique #E Cymevan#! culture#!"

  me_cymeva_2_title: "The End of the High Elven Peace"
  me_cymeva_2_desc: "For close to five centuries our people have been divided between the two #E Elfrealms#! of #E Horteon#!! "
  me_cymeva_2.a: "We shall reclaim our rightful throne!"
  me_cymeva_2_tooltip: "#R We will declare war on the [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"

  me_cymeva_3_title: "A Call to Arms"
  me_cymeva_3_desc: "My King, the #E 31st Dynasty#! calls for our aid!\n\nDespite our petty rivalry, the emergence of the #E #R Sertemic Kingdom of Baetep#!#! has posed both a threat and an opportunity we could no longer avoid. Through negotiations, Queen [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] has promised us rule over the #E Upper Baetep#! in exchange for our support in her struggle to reclaim the #E Pomegranate Throne#!. Thus, while we might not agree with the #E House of Djedhid#!, it is better to have a familiar enemy on the throne than a hostile foreigner.\n\nThrough our King's passionate oration as well as subtle display of force, the neighboring kingdoms of [GetCountry('AKH').GetName] and [GetCountry('PTH').GetName] have allied themselves to our cause, bolstering our numbers against the #E Sertemic#! threat!"
  me_cymeva_3.a: "The Sons of the Nihil will fight alongside the True Pharon!"
  me_cymeva_3_tooltip: "#R We will join [GetCountry('DUN').GetName]'s war against [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"

  me_cymeva_4_title: "Cymeva Invades"
  me_cymeva_4_desc: "My #E Pharon#!, urgent news arrives to us from the south! Invading armies of both the [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] have crossed into our borders!\n\nWhile I understand it is preposterous to believe, Queen [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] of the #E 31st Dynasty#! claims the #E Pomegranate Throne#! under the pretext of being the #E True Pharon#! and descendants of the #E 30th Dynasty#! wiped out by #E #R Zanis the Great#!#! long ago. Alongside her are the #E Agaetepians#! as well as a coalition of the various other independent states of the #E Upper Baetep#! who have sworn fealty to her in exchange for land or wealth.\n\nThe #E Djedhid Family#! of the [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] have long been a thorn in the side of the #E #R Zani#!#! and later [GetCountry('EGA').GetName], who never managed to fully wipe them out. They are the final hurdle blocking us from controlling all of the wealth of the #E Nihil#!, and their defeat shall surely place us as one of the #E Great Powers#! of #E Omniluxia#!!"
  me_cymeva_4.a: "Those fools march to their deaths"
  me_cymeva_4_tooltip: "#R The [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] will contest us for control of the #E Pomegranate Throne#!#!"

  me_cymeva_5_title: "The High Elven Civil War Continues"
  me_cymeva_5_desc: "My lord, word comes far from the wealthy #E Baetep#! that a great war has begun between two mighty kingdoms.\n\nOne, a foreign but stable dynasty that rules most of the wealthier regions of the #E Nihil#!. The other, an ancient dynasty that claims to trace back to the #E 30th Dynasty of the Baetep#!, the last native dynasty before #E #R Zanic#!#! rule. For centuries their realm lay hidden away in the sand cymevas, only now emerging to reclaim their throne alongside their allies.\n\nWhichever side wins this war, it is certain that it will have grand ramifications on the political landscape of #E Northern Luxterra#!!"
  me_cymeva_5.a: "All this blood spilt over sand?"
  me_cymeva_5_tooltip: "#R The two dynasties will clash over who will control the #E Baetep#!!#!"

  me_cymeva_6_title: "Horteonic Pragmatism"
  me_cymeva_6_desc: "My emperor, exciting news has arrived from the lost #E Baetep#! province!\n\n#E Upper Baetepian#! barbarians are waging a war against the traitorous #E Sertem#!, shaking what was their stable rule over the region.\n\nWhile I understand our armies are still recovering from the damage brought forth by #E #R Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!#!, there is a case to be made for war. With their armies in the south fighting the stubborn [GetCountry('DUN').GetName], this would be an excellent time to strike and regain our control over such a wealthy province!"
  me_cymeva_6.a: "We would be fools not to take advantage of this!"
  me_cymeva_6_tooltip.a: "#Y We will declare war on the [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"
  me_cymeva_6.b: "Our Empire needs stability, not conquest"
