 03_cymeva: "The High Elves of Cymeva"
 03_cymeva_DESCRIPTION: "Following the deaths of both #E Calidriel#! and #E Cymeva#!, the #E High Elven#! kingdoms of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [GetCountry('ATH').GetName] coexisted in accordance with the #E #G Great High Elven Peace#!#!.\n\nThe Cymevans under [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] have used the last two hundred years of peace to settle parts of #E Northern Eptelon#! as well as send out #E #R Slaver Ships#!#! to raid the coasts of #E Arteon#! and #E Eptelon#!. Focusing on rebuilding their economy, forming a professional standing army of elite soldiers, and accruing slaves to do the menial labor so that elven men may join the army, the Cymevans are prepared to finally challenge [GetCharacter('(int32)33').GetName] for control of #E Horteon#!!"
 03_cymeva_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has united the #E High Elves#! of #E Horteon#!."
 03_cymeva_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "We will unite the High Elves under our rule!"

 03_cymeva_task_1: "A National Spirit"
 03_cymeva_task_1_DESC: "Even after the #E #R Great High Elven Civil War#!#! our people considered themselves culturally connected to those in the west. We were all #E High Elves#! descended from the sons of #E #R Atheus the Conquerer#!#!! However, centuries of division and isolation has created a unique identity in the more cosmopolitan elves that population the #E Cymevan#! realm, and it is time to decide if this new culture truly defines who we are."
 
 03_cymeva_task_2: "Vaur-Ac Warriors"
 03_cymeva_task_2_DESC: "Traditional elven warriors fight in half-plated steel armor, either accompanied with a longbow or with a #E Trac#!, called a 'Glaive' by the #E Horteonians#!. Under [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] we have established a professional army, so now it is imperative that we select the best of the best to form an elite unite of warriors to serve as shock infantry for the battles to come: the #E Vaur-Ac Warriors#!."

 03_cymeva_task_3: "Ending the Peace"
 03_cymeva_task_3_DESC: "The #E High Elven Peace#! has lasted ever since the death of the two kings that started the #E #R Great High Elven Civil War#!#!, however, it did not determine a decisive victor. With manpower from our colonies supporting our standing army, we can finally continue the #E #R Great Elven Civil War#!#! and firmly declare ourselves the victors!"

 03_cymeva_task_4: "Unite the High Elves"
 03_cymeva_task_4_DESC: "With the #E Atheusians#! defeated, we can finally claim complete control over the entire #E High Elven Realm of Horteon#!, one of the greatest powers in the history of #E Omniluxia#!!"





### EVENTS
  me_cymeva_1_title: "Sons of Cymeva"
  me_cymeva_1_desc: "Centuries have passed since our people could consider themselves part of a whole #E Atheusian#! realm. While #E High Elves#! live long lives, very few if any remain that can still recall the days of the united #E High Order#!.\n\nIn that time, our people have become more urban, cosmopolitan, and belligerent than our rural western 'brothers'. With war looming on the horizon, many wonder if we should continue to claim the legacy of #E #R Atheus the Conquerer#!#! or promote our local culture as sons of #E Cymeva#!."
  me_cymeva_1.a: "We are Atheusians!"
  me_cymeva_1_tooltip.a: "#T [GetCountry('ACY').GetName] will uphold the #E Atheusian#! culure#!"
  me_cymeva_1.b: "We are Cymevans!"
  me_cymeva_1_tooltip.b: "#T [GetCountry('ACY').GetName] will embrace their unique #E Cymevan#! culture#!"

  me_cymeva_2_title: "The End of the High Elven Peace"
  me_cymeva_2_desc: "For close to five centuries our people have been divided between the two #E Elfrealms#! of #E Horteon#!, stifling our growth and costing us our empire.\n\nNo longer shall we accept this status quo!\n\nMessengers have already been sent to the colonies, calling for additional manpower to bolster our forces. Our #E Horteonian#! subjects as recruited to serve as scouts and auxiliaries. Our armies now march with purpose towards [GetProvince('(int32)142').GetName|Y], seeking to fulfill [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName]'s dream to restore the #E High Order#! and the #E Ascendic Empire#! under our rightful rule, as the true successors of #E Atheus the Conquerer#!!"
  me_cymeva_2.a: "Onwards! To glory!"
  me_cymeva_2_tooltip: "#R We will declare war on the [GetCountry('ATH').GetName]#!"

  me_cymeva_3_title: "The Great Civil War Continues"
  me_cymeva_3_desc: "My lord, terrible news. It seems that the presumptuous and prideful [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName] has let his greed and ambition get in the way of reason!\n\nThe forces of [GetCountry('ACY').GetName] now march on our lands, seeking to take [GetProvince('(int32)142').GetName|Y] and reunite the #E High Order of Atheus#!.\n\nHowever, this fight is far from over, and we are more than able to defeat this upstart on the battlefield. Their troops are trained as professional soldiers much like in the days of #E Atheus the Great#!, but what we lack in quality we more than make up in quantity.\n\nShould we defeat the #E Cymevans#!, there is hope that we could unite the #E Elfrealms#! of the north under our banner, and finally honor the legacy of #E Atheus#!!"
  me_cymeva_3.a: "Rally the troops in the name of Atheus!"
  me_cymeva_3_tooltip: "#R We will fight [GetCountry('ACY').GetName] to unite the #E High Elves#!#!"

  me_cymeva_4_title: "A Call to Arms"
  me_cymeva_4_desc: "My King, word has come from our overlord, [GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName]! He demands men and gold for his war to unite the #E Elfrealms#! of #E Horteon#! under his banner!\n\nObviously our men are eager to serve alongside their countrymen in #E Horteon#!, and I have no doubts of your loyalty to [GetProvince('(int32)345').GetName|Y], but there have been murmurs of dissent coming from both the government and the people.\n\nSpeculations that the #E Cymevans#! see us nothing more as extra manpower have begun circulating, and there are those that would prefer to see our overlord punished rather than succeed.\n\nOf course, the loyalty of the men and of the people is to you, my King. We shall follow you to the battlefield, whether it be against or for the #E Cymevans#!."
  me_cymeva_4.a: "Now's our chance!"
  me_cymeva_4_tooltip.a: "#R We will lead a war of independence against [GetCountry('ACY').GetName]#!"
  me_cymeva_4.b: "Ready the ships!"
  me_cymeva_4_tooltip.b: "#R We will join [GetCountry('ACY').GetName]'s war against [GetCountry('ATH').GetName]#!"
  

  me_cymeva_5_title: "The Colonies in Revolt"
  me_cymeva_5_desc: "[GetCharacter('(int32)125').GetName], terrible news from the colonies! It seems that COLONY NAME has not headed our call for men, and has instead risen against us!\n\nWhile crushing their small army would not be a troubling affair, our current campaign against [GetCountry('ATH').GetName] means that we cannot afford to stretch our forces too thin!\n\nGreat King, I know your wisdom will see us through this turmoil. Should we win this war quickly, the traitors shall be punished!"
  me_cymeva_5.a: "They dare rise up against me?"
  me_cymeva_5_tooltip: "#R COLONY NAME will lead a war of independence against us!#!"

  me_cymeva_6_title: "The High Elven Civil War Continues"
  me_cymeva_6_desc: "Great King, word has reached us from the far lands of #E Horteon#!! Little information reaches us from this distant land, the extent of our knowledge tells us that it is a cold land with a few human tribes dominated by the two great #E Elfrealms#! of the #E High Elves#! that have lived in peace far longer than we can remember.\n\nDespite this knowledge, word has arrived that the two realms now fight for control over the #E Land of Fire and Ice#! in a bitter struggle that will see only one victor."
  me_cymeva_6.a: "Those pointy-eared snobs are still fighting?"
  me_cymeva_6_tooltip: "#R The two elfrealms will clash over who will control the #E High Elves#! of #E Horteon#!!#!"

  me_cymeva_7_title: "The Elfrealms at War"
  me_cymeva_7_desc: "Great Chief! Word comes from the dreaded #E Elfrealms#! of the south.\n\nMerchants and travelers have been spreading the news that the #E #R Great Elven Civil War#!#! has continued, and that the #E Elfrealms#! once again face each other on the battlefield.\n\nThe last time they were at odds our people were too disorganized and disheartened to fight, however we have no such luxury now! They have encroached on our territory and taken our people to serve then as slaves. Every opportunity that we don't take now is a chance missed to retake our homeland.\n\nNow seems like an excellent time to strike, if we are able to rally our tribesmen against the #E High Elves#!, we might yet still have a chance at freeing #E Horteon#!!"
  me_cymeva_7.a: "Rally the warriors!"
  me_cymeva_7_tooltip: "#Y We will gain claims on the #E #R Elfrealms#!#!#!"
