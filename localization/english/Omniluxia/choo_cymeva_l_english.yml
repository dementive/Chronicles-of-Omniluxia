 03_cymeva_DESCRIPTION: "Ever since the fall of the #E 30th Dynasty#! and the capture of [GetProvince('(int32)2805').GetName], the native #E Baetepians#! have never ruled more than small kingdoms in the #E Upper Baetep#!, subjects in their own homeland. While the #Y Lower Baetepians#! saw greater assimilation into #R Geallian#! society, the #Y Upper Baetepians#! under the new #E 31st Dynasty#!, the #E Djedhid#!, fiercly defended their independence, only seeing brief periods of subjugation.\n\nDespite their numerous attempts to retake their homelands, the various Upper Baetepian Kingdoms have failed to reclaim the #E Pomegranate Throne#!, as the occupying #R Geallian#! forces always fought fiercly to protect one of their most valuable provinces. However, the #E #R Invasions of Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!#! and the creation of the #R Sertemic Kingdom of Baetep#! have opened up a new opportunity for the inhabitants of the south.\n\nAllied together in a common cause, the once-rival states of [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] now seek to place [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] on the #E Pomegranate Throne#!!"

 03_cymeva_task_2_DESC: "While we are confident our combined forces can thrash the cowardly #E Sertem#!, it is important that we protect our valuable cities from possible incursions into our territory."

### EVENTS
  me_cymeva_1_title: "An Avatar of the Gods"
  me_cymeva_1_desc: "Ever since the days of #E 23rd Dynasty#! the #E Pharons#! of the #E Baetep Kingdom#! have been avatars of the god #E #G Khewer#!#!, the rightful ruler and protector of the wealthy #E Lower Baetep#!! His authority has given the #E Djedhid#! dynasty the legitimacy it seeks to claim the #E #Y Pomegranate Throne#!#!.\n\nHowever, centuries have passed since the center of independent Baetepic power shifted from [GetProvince('(int32)2805').GetName] to [GetProvince('(int32)3735').GetName], and many religious advisors that surround the queen now claim that a different god now leads her people, a god of the #E Upper Baetep#!.\n\nThey advise the queen to host the god #E #G Senedejr#!#!, the one and only #E God of Gods, King of All#!, to help guide her in her quest to unite the #E Baetep#! under her rule.\n\nWhile hosting a new god would signal the start of a new prosperous age for the #E 31st Dynasty#!, it was the avatars of #E #G Khewer#!#! who reconquered the #E Baetep#! from foreign invaders. The queen ponders this question."
  me_cymeva_1.a: "I shall host the God of Gods, King of All"
  me_cymeva_1_tooltip.a: "#G [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] will become the avatar of #E Senedejr#!#!"

  me_cymeva_2_title: "War of the Pomegranate Throne"
  me_cymeva_2_desc: "The time has come to reclaim our rightful throne! The #E Pomegranate Throne#! shall be occupied by foreigners no longer!\n\nAs our forces cross the desert into #E Sertemic#! territory our allies in the east rally together to open another front against those loyal to the false rulers of the #E 32nd Dynasty#!!\n\nDespite our numbers, this war will not be easy. The #E Sertem#! have managed to stabilize their realm, and will use all the wealth of the #E Lower Baetep#! against us. We can only hope that the gods will deliver us victory, and that others might also prey on the foreign dogs."
  me_cymeva_2.a: "We shall reclaim our rightful throne!"
  me_cymeva_2_tooltip: "#R We will declare war on the [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"

  me_cymeva_3_title: "A Call to Arms"
  me_cymeva_3_desc: "My King, the #E 31st Dynasty#! calls for our aid!\n\nDespite our petty rivalry, the emergence of the #E #R Sertemic Kingdom of Baetep#!#! has posed both a threat and an opportunity we could no longer avoid. Through negotiations, Queen [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] has promised us rule over the #E Upper Baetep#! in exchange for our support in her struggle to reclaim the #E Pomegranate Throne#!. Thus, while we might not agree with the #E House of Djedhid#!, it is better to have a familiar enemy on the throne than a hostile foreigner.\n\nThrough our King's passionate oration as well as subtle display of force, the neighboring kingdoms of [GetCountry('AKH').GetName] and [GetCountry('PTH').GetName] have allied themselves to our cause, bolstering our numbers against the #E Sertemic#! threat!"
  me_cymeva_3.a: "The Sons of the Nihil will fight alongside the True Pharon!"
  me_cymeva_3_tooltip: "#R We will join [GetCountry('DUN').GetName]'s war against [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"

  me_cymeva_4_title: "The Djedhid Invade"
  me_cymeva_4_desc: "My #E Pharon#!, urgent news arrives to us from the south! Invading armies of both the [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] have crossed into our borders!\n\nWhile I understand it is preposterous to believe, Queen [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] of the #E 31st Dynasty#! claims the #E Pomegranate Throne#! under the pretext of being the #E True Pharon#! and descendants of the #E 30th Dynasty#! wiped out by #E #R Zanis the Great#!#! long ago. Alongside her are the #E Agaetepians#! as well as a coalition of the various other independent states of the #E Upper Baetep#! who have sworn fealty to her in exchange for land or wealth.\n\nThe #E Djedhid Family#! of the [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] have long been a thorn in the side of the #E #R Zani#!#! and later [GetCountry('EGA').GetName], who never managed to fully wipe them out. They are the final hurdle blocking us from controlling all of the wealth of the #E Nihil#!, and their defeat shall surely place us as one of the #E Great Powers#! of #E Omniluxia#!!"

  me_cymeva_4_tooltip: "#R The [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] will contest us for control of the #E Pomegranate Throne#!#!"

  me_cymeva_5_title: "War of the Pomegranate Throne"
  me_cymeva_5_desc: "My lord, word comes far from the wealthy #E Baetep#! that a great war has begun between two mighty kingdoms.\n\nOne, a foreign but stable dynasty that rules most of the wealthier regions of the #E Nihil#!. The other, an ancient dynasty that claims to trace back to the #E 30th Dynasty of the Baetep#!, the last native dynasty before #E #R Zanic#!#! rule. For centuries their realm lay hidden away in the sand cymevas, only now emerging to reclaim their throne alongside their allies.\n\nWhichever side wins this war, it is certain that it will have grand ramifications on the political landscape of #E Northern Luxterra#!!"
  me_cymeva_5.a: "All this blood spilt over sand?"

With their armies in the south fighting the stubborn [GetCountry('DUN').GetName], this would be an excellent time to strike and regain our control over such a wealthy province!"
  me_cymeva_6.a: "We would be fools not to take advantage of this!"
  me_cymeva_6_tooltip.a: "#Y We will declare war on the [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"

  me_cymeva_7_title: "The Razani Invade"
  me_cymeva_7_desc: "Wise Pharon, trouble has arisen in the east! The vengeful [GetCountry('EGA').GetName] has noticed our predicament, and decided to ruin their own country at the expense of ours.\n\nWhile the #E Razani#! are able to field large armies, their crumbling empire has the misfortune of being far less stable than ours.\n\nShould we fend off their hordes, they might fall into infighting and insurrection, allowing us to focus our attention on the south."
  me_cymeva_7.a: "We would never stoop this low"
  me_cymeva_7_tooltip: "#R [GetCountry('EGA').GetName] has invaded [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"

  me_cymeva_8_title: "The Golden Crusade Begins"
  me_cymeva_8_desc: "My King, excellent news! The heathen #E Sertem#! are caught in a ruinous war against the [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName]!\n\nWith their armies distracted, the undefended towns and cities of the #E Nihil#! are practically ours for the taking! Towns full of idols will burn, and #E #G Helluvius#!'#! salvation will be brought to the unfortunate souls that haven't seen his light. Thus, it can only be certain that it is our duty to begin this holy #T #E Golden Crusade#!#!!\n\nOur eager knights await your command, Glory to Hellas!"
  me_cymeva_8.a: "FOR HELLAS"
  me_cymeva_8_tooltip.a: "#R We will declare a Holy War upon [GetCountry('EGY').GetName]#!"
