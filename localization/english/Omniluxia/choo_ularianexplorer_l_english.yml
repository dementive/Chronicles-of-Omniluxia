### EVENTS
 ularianexplorer_1_title: "Ok-Opun the Explorer"
 ularianexplorer_1_desc: "My Emperor, word from the small seaside city of [GetProvince('(int32)2422').GetName] is that a local lord has coordinated with a small number of #R #E Helluvian#!#! converts living in the the surrounding area to go on a voyage abroad. Their motives are officially unknown, but it can be assumed they are seeking to flee persecution from our administrative and religious authorities, as their faith is banned in our Empire.\n\nWhile their destination is unknown, we suspect that he is attempting to flee to either the #E Bloody Isles#! or the #E Lands of the Snakefolk#!. Regardless of his destination, it is almost certain that he will meet his end at the blade of some uncivilized despot.\n\nWhat is known of this expedition is the leader, a young #E Ularian#! nobleman by the name of #E Ok-Opun#!. Caught worshipping the false god #E Hellas#! he was sentenced to death under your grace's decree, only to slip out of our hands. It was speculated that he was hiding in the nearby forests, gathering supporters and possibly planning this journey.\n\nRegardless, their goals pose no threat to our rule, and sending in Imperial forces to detain them would only waste time and resources to hold onto a few heathen families. I would assume your imperial majesty would agree?"
 ularianexplorer_1.a: "Let that fool sail to his death."
 ularianexplorer_1_tooltip.a: "#G #E Ok-Opun#! will sail off to find a new homeland for his people!#!"
 
 ularianexplorer_2_title: "A Stanger Arrives in Narbolia"
 ularianexplorer_2_desc: "My liege, unrecognized ships has arrived in the harbor of [GetProvince('(int32)2187').GetName]! The vessel is filled with #E Geallian#! families, and is led by a captain who calls himself #E Ok-Opun#!.\n\nFrom what we can understand from his broken #E Orcish#!, he and his crew are fleeing the persecution of the [GetCountry('WGA').GetName], seeking to create a new homeland for themselves in the lands of the #E Snakes#! where they can practice their faith in peace. He asks for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s help in his voyage, hopping to procure supplies for hte long journey.\n\nWhile the aggressive and isolationist #E Snakefolk#! are sure to attack their frail group of farmers and herders, the god preached by the Explorer intruiges many in court. From what we can understand from his captivating lectures, this #E Hellas#! encourages his followers to seek to grow their #E #R Inner Flame#!#! by growing the flames of those who have the dimmest lights. Intruiging indeed!\n\nWhen he leaves the court, various chiefs share their opinions to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]. Some demand the explusion of the stranger, stating that no #R Shuar#! are to be trusted, while others say that he should be sent away with supplies, as the #E Geallians#! are active supporters of our country. The more curious chieftains suggest that the stranger be made a subject of the King, teaching us the ways of this #E Hellas#!."

He was found on a ship full of his countrymen that attempted to dock at [GetProvince('(int32)1851').GetName], asking for an audience with you.\n\nHe states his goal is to journey to the islands of the #E Snakefolk#! to fina a new homeland for his people, and asks us for food and supplies to make the long journey across the #E Serpentine Sea#! manageable for his kinsmen.\n\nMost chiefs scoff at his request, what kind of #E Orc#! would help an deceitful #R Shuar#!?"

 ularianexplorer_4_desc: "My serptentine sovereign, a foreigner has appeared in the harbors of [GetProvince('(int32)5694').GetName].\n\nNormally, humans would be killed on sight, however this man claims to come from a far away empire not connected to the hostile #E Eptelonians#! or #E Arteonians#!.\n\nLast we heard of the southern continents was the breakup of a great empire, possibly the empire of the so-called #E Sani#!. Thus, this foreigners intruiging story earned him an audience with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName].\n\nHe asks for supplies as well as for land for his people to settle on. While his story was interesting, this petition is outlandish, as a human would never be allowed to settle on #E Snakefolk#! territory.\n\nThe chief's marshal suggests sending him to the southern islands, where the savage natives are sure to dispose of him for us. Meanwhile, our wise one asks that the king consider the information the man might have, and keep him at court."

He claims to come from a great empire to the south, and brings with him many families with him.\n\nHe asks for our aid, some land for his people to farm or supplies to keep them going on their long journey.\n\nObviously this foreigner does not understand what his people have done to us, how they have forsaken us and left us in eternal war with our #E Snakefolk#! enemies. Many clan chieftains argue that we should show mercy to him, as he leads many women and children. However, if he is not to be killed, his people should at least be expelled from our lands!"

Should we not kill him on the spot, the cruel [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] will take care of them."

 ularianexplorer_7_desc: "My King, a foreigner calling themself #E Ok-Opun#! has requested an audience with you.\n\nWhile I am aware of your decree to kill all humans on sight, he is unlike the #E Eptelonians#! and #E Arteonians#! who once raided our shores. His people have pale skin, and claim to come from the #E Sani Empire#!.\n\nHe asks for land for his people to settle, ready to become a vassal of your majesty if you desire so.\n\nInformation about the southern continents are hard to come by, and his knowledge on mathematics and sciences are impressive for a human. He might show himself to be an excellent vassal, developing his lands in ways we could never imagine.\n\nHowever, he is still human, a race more deceitful than the #E Austropetolians#!. Most of us support his expulsion, but the fate of him and his people are up to you my lord."

 ularianexplorer_8_title: "Ok-Opun Settles Down"
 ularianexplorer_8_desc: "My Chief, a human has arrived on our shores! He is unlike any human wwe have seen before, pale with strange robes and a brown beard.\n\nHis complexion intruiged us, so we heard out his request. He is looking for a homeland for his people, and seeks to settle onto one of the surrounding islands.\n\nWhile granting him lands in our great kingdom is certainly out of the question, there are a few islands to our north that might serve him well should he be able to pacify the natives.\n\nHowever, our people are intruiged by the design of his boats, weapons, cooking tools, and more. Should he stay in our country, he may be of great use to us."
