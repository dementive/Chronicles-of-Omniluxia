03_jaraharum: "The Dolin of the Mountain Hold"
03_jaraharum_DESCRIPTION: "For nearly four hundred years we have been at peace, however, with attacks ramping up against our goblin allies, our nation is now presented with new opportunities. While our new King, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] of the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective], has his ambitions set on expanding his kingdom, the nobles of the realm distrust his rule.\n\nSince he was a child, Ivarr had always been strange, preferring the few Goblinic advisors and caretakers over dwarven ones. His rule was marked by unpopular conscription and tax laws across the kingdom, and he has passed many centralizing reforms that have been seen as tyrannical by many members of the nobility.\n\nHaving called a grand meeting with the Kana'i Goblin chiefs, many nobles plot to overthrow the king using the help of the Goblins, while the King intends to expand his control and his power across the Dragon's Pass. The outcome of this meeting will change the fate of the Kingdom and Southern Morrigon for centuries to come.\n"
03_jaraharum_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has established its dominance over the Dragon's Pass."
03_jaraharum_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Onwards, to the future!"

#Missions 
####EMPIRE
03_jaraharum_task_1: "The Great Purge"
03_jaraharum_task_1_DESC: "Despite his reclusive nature and eccentric personality, the young King of the Dolin is acutely aware of the danger he is in. Isolated from all but a few nobles, the King is aware of their plots against them, and to combat their plays for his throne he must ensure he has loyal subjects in key positions to wipe out all threats to his power."

03_jaraharum_task_2: "Subjugate the Goblins"
03_jaraharum_task_2_DESC: "With the threats to his power removed, the King can now use the full force of his kingdom as he pleases. However, in order to reach his true ambitions, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] must first control the entire Dragon's Pass."

03_jaraharum_task_3: "A Grand Army"
03_jaraharum_task_3_DESC: "Now that we have united the Dragon's Pass, we must consolidate our hold over our recently conquered subjects and use them to add to our strength. We must make a grand army of goblins and dwarves that will be capable of handling the wars to come and enforcing the King's will over the entire realm!"

03_jaraharum_task_4: "An Academy of Our Own"
03_jaraharum_task_4_DESC: "Now that the King has consolidated his realm, he can begin to pursue his magical ambitions. A gifted sorcerer, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] looks for a place where he can hone his skills, innovate, and discuss magic with other wizards away from prying eyes in the capital.\n\nSurveying his lands, he has come across the perfect candidate for such a place: a small settlement called [GetProvince('(int32)5561').GetName|Y]. With a deposit of soul gems and a small mage community, the King invites gifted talent across the realm and abroad to come to his newly built town and academy."

03_jaraharum_task_5: "The Hobgoblin Academy"
03_jaraharum_task_5_DESC: "With all the necessary pieces in place, the King now only needs one more thing before he is able to realize his ambitions; the twin Hobgoblin academies of Driotrapan and Muiltek. Their researchers are the only ones in Omniluxia known to research the rare 'Soul Stealing' abilities of the Goblins. Their work will be instrumental to our young King's plans."

03_jaraharum_task_6: "The Soul Stealer"
03_jaraharum_task_6_DESC: "When he was a child, Ivarr's parents assigned him a Kana'i goblin nurse; unprecedented in Jaraharum history. This nurse, a dwarf-blood, had risen up the ranks of the court, and while garnering the suspicion of some, she had gained the trust of the royal couple. When putting him to bed, she imparted the young prince with stories of Goblinic history; their creation by Wishtheon and subsequent sabotage at the hands of Mother Earth. Their descent into savagery as they were disfigured and cast into the depths of the caves of Omniluxia. Their despair and salvation, as Melodius took pity on them, gifting them with the ability to absorb man'a, or life energy, from other beings to compensate for the lack of the ability to generate it.\nAs the child grew up, he would attempt to gather a retinue of Kana'i goblins just like his nurse to learn more about their culture and their special ability, seemingly entranced by the idea of a 'soul' and the old stories of Goblins absorbing the 'souls' of their enemies. This did not go unnoticed by the court, and soon his parents forced the young king to replace his retinue with one of Dolin dwarves. However, the young King never really fit into Dolin society, and further isolated himself, gathering tomes about Goblinic physiology and beliefs, until his ascension to the throne.\nNow, with the space to conduct his research, a foundation of studies to base his research on, and numerous talented young pupils who are familiar with 'Soul Stealing', he can finally fully dedicate himself to the study of the technique."

03_jaraharum_task_7: "An Immortal Empire"
03_jaraharum_task_7_DESC: "Now possessing the power he so desired, the young King Ivarr 'to Boddamogg', the Devourer, now has the armies and the power he needs to create an empire emitting from his mountain capital, with him as its Emperor. The armies of this Immortal Empire, or Ekkdejakheim, will march down from its mountains and take its role as the ruler of South Morrigon!"

####CONFEDERATION
03_jaraharum_task_8: "Conspire With the Chiefs"
03_jaraharum_task_8_DESC: "With the grand meeting approaching soon, the most influential nobles of the realm have gathered to discuss the Tyrant King. Everybody knows he is planning something, however the erratic and unknown nature of his plans are what worry the nobility. Alone, even with their personal forces, they cannot hope to stand against the King, however, with some external help they do stand a chance.\n\nThe neighboring Kana'i are sympathetic to the nobles' cause. If the nobles are able to convince them to help, they should finally have enough manpower to overthrow the Tyrant King."

03_jaraharum_task_9: "Drafting a Consitution"
03_jaraharum_task_9_DESC: ""

03_jaraharum_task_10: "Sister Cities"
03_jaraharum_task_10_DESC: "While our Goblinic allies can adapt to city life well, their homelands have been historically rural. In order to civilize and develop their lands, our confederacy has decided to invest into a number of promising villages to create 'Sister Cities' that will develop and grow side-by-side."

03_jaraharum_task_11: "Hobgoblin Allies"
03_jaraharum_task_11_DESC: "While our people are prospering, we must ensure that they are safe from the enemies that surround us. While the Droyuni Hobgoblins of Droitrai are historically hostile to us and our Goblin allies, we both have a common enemy in the belligerent and crumbling [GetCountry('SOV').GetName].\n\nIf we were to ally, we could rely on their strength in our future wars."

03_jaraharum_task_12: "Hobgoblin Mages"
03_jaraharum_task_12_DESC: "Historically suspicious of magic, our people have seen it's effectiveness by observing our Hobgoblin allies in battle. Their mages are willing to teach us, however we have no academies for them to teach at.\n\nSurveying our realm, there is one possible candidate that stands out among the rest: the small village of Jorrmundath. Its relative proximity to Jarahabi and deposit of Soul Gems make it an attractive location for possible scholars. With a little investment, it could become a thriving city filled with magical academies!"

03_jaraharum_task_13: "Dragkhanic Research / Fighting the Dragons?"
03_jaraharum_task_13_DESC: "With our Hobgoblin Allies by our side, we can confidently march on the Sovenerians and secure the South Gate. However, with these conquests comes the influx of Dragkhanic research and knowledge. Much more advanced than what we currently possess, we should use their research and scholars to improve our own nation!"

03_jaraharum_task_14: "Integrating the Kana'i"
03_jaraharum_task_14_DESC: "Due to the close proximity of our two cultures, many Kana'i have adopted Dolin culture and vice versa. While some elders object to this fraternization, the growing number of educated nobles believe that we can learn something from our Goblinic allies.\n\nWe should make further efforts to integrate and understand our allies!"

03_jaraharum_task_15: "A Syncretic Faith"
03_jaraharum_task_15_DESC: ""


#####DEVELOPMENT
03_jaraharum_task_16: "Mountain Riches"
03_jaraharum_task_16_DESC: "Our mountains hold a significant amount of minerals and metals that are craved by all nations across Morrigon. To use this untapped potential, we should invest into these rural territories."

03_jaraharum_task_17: "The North and South Gates"
03_jaraharum_task_17_DESC: "The Inner Dragon's Pass has seen many armies pass through, be they Goblin, Human, Drakhan, Hobgoblin, or even Dwarven, with their journeys typically causing destruction to the native inhabitants. Now that we control all of the Inner Dragon's Pass, we must make sure that enemy armies cannot enter our lands so easily. Creating defensive fortifications on both the North and South Gates of Tipuka Aka and Tipuka Ema'a  would be an excellent way to defend our borders."

03_jaraharum_task_18: "Feeding the Masses"
03_jaraharum_task_18_DESC: "The mountainous nature of the Inner Dragon Pass means that there is few if any arable land throughout our entire realm. To be able to feed our growing population we must import and store large quantities of food lest we face widespread famine."

03_jaraharum_task_19: "The Mountain Hold"
03_jaraharum_task_19_DESC: "Our city is known as 'The Mountain Hold' across the Dragon Pass and the Dragon Lands due to its location and size. However, with our newly developed riches we should invest in making our city a true underground metropolis and the premier trading hub of Southern Morrigon worthy of the title of 'Sorrborr'."

me_jaraharum_1_title: "The Great Meeting"
me_jaraharum_1_desc: "The Goblin chiefs arrive in awe of the size of the legendary Mountain Hold, and are greeted by the King with great splendor. They dine in a great hall in the palace and discuss pleasantries and stories across the table. However, once the food runs out the mood begins to sour. The great King has brought out his army in a show of strength, and many chiefs whisper to each other in uneasy tones. All night the King has used a goblin interpreter to speak with his guests, but now the King makes an announcement in the Kana'i language:\n\n'The Treaty of Two Friends has defined both our external and internal affairs policies for centuries, and strengthened the bond between our two peoples. However, with new, stronger enemies rising around us, this archaic document is now more of a hindrance to our potential than a guarantor of peace. I plan to create an eternal peace through conquest, and I need your support to do so. However, if you intend to stand in my way, my armies will descend onto your lands, be you friends or foes.'\n\nThe King procures a document, a copy of the ancient treaty itself. Watching as the King rips the copy and tosses it into a nearby fireplace, the chiefs must decide their answer."

me_jaraharum_3_title: "Ton Ubaturren ulfton Thorgarren"
me_jaraharum_3_desc: "After weeks of negotiations and debates, the leaders of both parties have managed to find a compromise. The following series of laws, known to all as the 'Ubaturren ulfton Thorgarren', or Reforms of the Citizens, are passed:\n1 - Citizenship will be extended to all freemen regardless of prior military service.\n2 - The council, now called the 'Sorrhlturr', the Great Thing, will be split into two branches. The 'Ghlattanvindr', or Father House, will be made up of 15 members of the Great Merchant families just like during the times of the Thyrr Ubaturren, while the 'Arnnanvindr', or Son House, will be made up of 100 representatives elected by their fellow citizens. Election terms for the Ghlattanvindr will be 4 years while it will be every two years for the Arnnhtlurr.\n3 - The Hatamogg role will be elected from Ghlattanvindr every four years by the members of the Arnnanvindr and serve as the face of the republic in international affairs, commander in chief of the army, and ensure laws passed by the Sorrhlturr are enforced onto the nation.\n4 - The Ghlattanvindr will be in charge of commercial and military affairs while the Arnnanvindr will be in charge of civilian and naval affairs. Both can present possible legislation which can be vetoed by the other. The Ghlattanvindr requires a majority vote to pass legislation while the Arnnanvindr required 3/4ths agreement to pass legislation. Possible legislation must be passed by both houses to become law.\n\nHaving formed a new government, the first Sorrhlturr makes a unanimous decision. No longer are we a simple 'rum', as we are no longer waiting for a king to return. Our new republic, born from the unity of the Saptan people, will be called Srroveldi, or the Silver Republic."

A pair of bright young Leslesi statesmen were adopted into the Segurrvelk family by an older retired merchant who had no heirs. The brothers, Vodenos and Cavarus, debated together with their new platform, their exemplary oratory skills making many old guard senators sympathetic towards Leslesi citizenship.\n\nFinally, after around a year of debates and legislation, the 'Janirr Thorgarren' Laws were finally passed by both houses, granting universal citizenship to all freemen of Leslesi descent as well as equal status and rights as Galmar dwarves."
