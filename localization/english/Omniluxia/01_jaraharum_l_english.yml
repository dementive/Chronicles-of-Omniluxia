03_jaraharum: "The Dolin of the Mountain Hold"
03_jaraharum_DESCRIPTION: "For nearly four hundred years we have been at peace, however, with attacks ramping up against our #E Goblin#! allies, our nation is now presented with new opportunities. While our new King, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] of the House of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective], has his ambitions set on expanding his kingdom, the nobles of the realm distrust his rule.\n\nSince he was a child, #E Ivarr#! had always been strange, preferring the few #E Goblinic#! advisors and caretakers over dwarven ones. His rule was marked by unpopular conscription and tax laws across the kingdom, and he has passed many centralizing reforms that have been seen as tyrannical by many members of the nobility.\n\nHaving called a grand meeting with the #E Kana'i Goblin#! chiefs, many nobles plot to overthrow the king using the help of the #E Goblins#!, while the King intends to expand his control and his power across the #E Dragon's Pass#!. The outcome of this meeting will change the fate of the realm and #E Southern Morrigon#! for centuries to come.\n"
03_jaraharum_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has established its dominance over the Dragon's Pass."
03_jaraharum_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "Onwards, to the future!"

#Missions
####EMPIRE
03_jaraharum_task_1: "The Great Purge"
03_jaraharum_task_1_DESC: "Despite his reclusive nature and eccentric personality, the young King of the #E Dolin#! is acutely aware of the danger he is in. Isolated from all but a few nobles, the King is aware of their plots against them, and to combat their plays for his throne he must ensure he has loyal subjects in key positions to wipe out all threats to his power."

03_jaraharum_task_2: "Subjugate the Goblins"
03_jaraharum_task_2_DESC: "With the threats to his power removed, the King can now use the full force of his kingdom as he pleases. However, in order to reach his true ambitions, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] must first control the entire #E Dragon's Pass#!."

03_jaraharum_task_3: "A Grand Army"
03_jaraharum_task_3_DESC: "Now that we have united the #E Dragon's Pass#!, we must consolidate our hold over our recently conquered subjects and use them to add to our strength. We must make a grand army of #E Goblins#! and #E Dwarves#! that will be capable of handling the wars to come and enforcing the King's will over the entire realm!"

03_jaraharum_task_4: "An Academy of Our Own"
03_jaraharum_task_4_DESC: "Now that the King has consolidated his realm, he can begin to pursue his magical ambitions. A gifted sorcerer, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] looks for a place where he can hone his skills, innovate, and discuss magic with other wizards away from prying eyes in the capital.\n\nSurveying his lands, he has come across the perfect candidate for such a place: a small settlement called [GetProvince('(int32)5561').GetName|Y]. With a deposit of soul gems and a small mage community, the King invites gifted talent across the realm and abroad to come to his newly built town and academy."

03_jaraharum_task_5: "The Hobgoblin Academy"
03_jaraharum_task_5_DESC: "With all the necessary pieces in place, the King now only needs one more thing before he is able to realize his ambitions; the #E Shoishoni#! mages of [GetProvince('(int32)4187').GetName|Y]. Their wizards are the only ones in #E Omniluxia#! known to research the rare '#E Soul Stealing#!' abilities of the #E Goblins#!. Their work will be instrumental to our young King's plans."

03_jaraharum_task_6: "The Soul Stealer"
03_jaraharum_task_6_DESC: "Finally, the #E #R Tyrant King#!#! now possesses all he needs to achieve his magical ambitions. However, the dark power he hopes to wield require a sacrifice, one that would satisfy the twisted urges of #E #R Melodias#!#!."

03_jaraharum_task_7: "An Immortal Empire"
03_jaraharum_task_7_DESC: "Now possessing the power he so desired, the young King #E Ivarr 'the Devourer'#!, now has the armies and the power he needs to create an empire emitting from his mountain capital, with him as its Emperor. The armies of this #E Immortal Empire#!, or #E Ekkdejakheim#!, will march down from its mountains and take its role as the ruler of #E South Morrigon#!!"

####CONFEDERATION
03_jaraharum_task_8: "Conspire With the Chiefs"
03_jaraharum_task_8_DESC: "With the grand meeting approaching soon, the most influential nobles of the realm have gathered to discuss the #E Tyrant King#!. Everybody knows he is planning something, however the erratic and unknown nature of his plans are what worry the nobility. Alone, even with their personal forces, they cannot hope to stand against the King, however, with some external help they do stand a chance.\n\nThe neighboring #E Kana'i#! are sympathetic to the nobles' cause. If the nobles are able to convince them to help, they should finally have enough manpower to overthrow the #E Tyrant King#!."

03_jaraharum_task_9: "Drafting a Consitution"
03_jaraharum_task_9_DESC: "With the King overthrown, the remaining nobles now must decide how to govern this #E Kingdom without a King#!, and determine their relationship with their various allied #E Goblin#! chiefs."

03_jaraharum_task_10: "Sister Cities"
03_jaraharum_task_10_DESC: "While our #E Goblinic#! allies can adapt to city life well, their homelands have been historically rural. In order to civilize and develop their lands, our confederacy has decided to invest into a number of promising villages to create '#E Sister Cities#!' that will develop and grow side-by-side."

03_jaraharum_task_11: "Hobgoblin Allies"
03_jaraharum_task_11_DESC: "While our people are prospering, we must ensure that they are safe from the enemies that surround us. While the #E Droyuni Hobgoblins#! of [GetProvince('(int32)4721').GetName|Y] are historically hostile to us and our #E Goblin#! allies, we both have a common enemy in the belligerent [GetCountry('SOV').GetName].\n\nIf we were to ally, we could rely on their strength in our future wars."

03_jaraharum_task_12: "Shoishoni Mages"
03_jaraharum_task_12_DESC: "Historically suspicious of magic, our people have seen it's effectiveness by observing our #E Hobgoblin#! allies in battle. Some #E Shoishoni#! mages are interested in teaching us, however we have no academies for them to teach at.\n\nSurveying our realm, there is one possible candidate that stands out among the rest: the small village of [GetProvince('(int32)5561').GetName|Y]. Its relative proximity to [GetProvince('(int32)5562').GetName|Y] and deposit of #E Soul Gems#! make it an attractive location for possible scholars. With a little investment, it could become a thriving city filled with magical academies!"

03_jaraharum_task_13: "Into Kainaxarthos"
03_jaraharum_task_13_DESC: "With our #E #G Hobgoblin Allies#!#! by our side, we can confidently march on the #E #R Sovenerians#!#! and secure the #E South Gate#!. If we can defeat the Empire's forces in battle, we might be able to claim a slice of #E Kainaxarthos#! for the Confederacy!"

03_jaraharum_task_14: "Integrating the Kana'i"
03_jaraharum_task_14_DESC: "Due to the close proximity of our two cultures, many #E Kana'i#! have adopted #E Dolin#! culture and vice versa. While some elders object to this fraternization, the growing number of educated nobles believe that we can learn something from our #E Goblinic#! allies.\n\nWe should make further efforts to integrate and understand our allies!"

03_jaraharum_task_15: "A Syncretic Faith"
03_jaraharum_task_15_DESC: "With more and more #G Kana'i#! adopting our customs and culture, it's only natural that their nigh demonic #R Melodian#! faith has begun to adopt elements from the #E Hebric#! faith! By employing a #G Kana'i#! #T High Priest#!, we may be able to encourage these practices, saving our friends from #R Melodias'#! whispers."


#####DEVELOPMENT
03_jaraharum_task_16: "Mountain Riches"
03_jaraharum_task_16_DESC: "Our mountains hold a significant amount of minerals and metals that are craved by all nations across #E Morrigon#!. To use this untapped potential, we should invest into these rural territories."

03_jaraharum_task_17: "The North and South Gates"
03_jaraharum_task_17_DESC: "The #E Inner Dragon's Pass#! has seen many armies pass through it, be they #E Goblin#!, #E Human#!, #E Dragkhan#!, #E Hobgoblin#!, or even #E Dwarven#!, with their journeys typically causing destruction to the native inhabitants. Now that we control all of the #E Inner Dragon's Pass#!, we must make sure that enemy armies cannot enter our lands so easily. Creating defensive fortifications on both the North and South Gates of [GetProvince('(int32)5551').GetName|Y] and [GetProvince('(int32)4460').GetName|Y] would be an excellent way to defend our borders."

03_jaraharum_task_18: "Feeding the Masses"
03_jaraharum_task_18_DESC: "The mountainous nature of the #E Inner Dragon Pass#! means that there is few if any arable land throughout our entire realm. To be able to feed our growing population we must import and store large quantities of food lest we face widespread famine."

03_jaraharum_task_19: "The Mountain Hold"
03_jaraharum_task_19_DESC: "Our city is known as '#E The Mountain Hold#!' across the #E Dragon's Pass#! and the #E Dragon Lands#! due to its location and size. However, with our newly developed riches we should invest in making our city a true underground metropolis and the premier trading hub of #E Southern Morrigon#! worthy of the title of '#E Sorrborr#!'."

Holding the pose for what seems like an eternity, the King steps aside to softly issue a series of commands to his Marshal. Thus, began the #R #E Great Purge#!#!."

Once everyone has had their fill as the guests awkwardly attempt to engage in conversation with the silent sovereign. His standoffish behaviour insults many of the proud chiefs, who in turn refuse to converse.\n\nOnce the embers of any conversation pitter out, [GetCharacter('(int32)87').GetName] calls over an attendant, softly issuing them a command. The confused chieftains look in shock and anger as the #R King's Guard#! outnumbers and surrounds the dinner table. All night the King has used a #E Goblin#! interpreter to speak with his guests, but now the King makes an announcement in #B Oli'le Kana#!:\n\n'#Y The #E Treaty of Two Friends#! has defined our relationship with you #E Kana'i#! for centuries, protecting us both from outsiders and strengthening the bond between our two peoples.

Losing his mother at a young age, this maid served as a motherly figure for the young heir, as his father mourned the loss of his queen during his formative years. To put him to sleep, she would secretly share with him stories of the #E #R Old Faith#!#!. \n\nThe prince loved these grand tales of the feats of #E Wishtheon#! and jealous actions of the #E Mother Earth#! who cursed the goblins and banished them to the caverns of the world.

They believe the longer-lived and wealthier #E Dolin#! could help serve as architects of such a state.\n\nDiscussion following the proposal is fierce, with talks almost breaking down several times. Despite all these setbacks, a formal constitution, called the #E Sorrskrágr#! or #E Kanawaike#! was written and accepted by all chiefs and nobles. Defining their government, powers and legislature, the parchment now just requires the signatures of all delegates at the meeting and an official name of the Confederation.\n\nThe #G Kana'i#! propose a compromise, stating that since the capital of the federation should be in [GetProvince('(int32)5562').GetName|Y] while the name should be in their tongue. They promise that the name they have chosen is significant to their past, as it continues the legacy of a great Confederation of their past.\n\nThe #E Dwarves#! argue that since their kingdom is the most wealthy and influential constituent of the Confederacy, they should recieve both the rights to the capital and the name.\n\nAfter much debate, the delegates make an agreement and sign their names, founding the Federation of:"
