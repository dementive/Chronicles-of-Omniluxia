 zerywani_1:0 "The Chosen of Jelen"
 zerywani_1_DESCRIPTION:0 "The children of Zehi once occupied a far greater amount of land, but as the aggressive #E Samoyi#! tribes pushed from the north, all of #E Dortry#! was lost. However, when all seemed doomed, the great celestial deer, Jelen, graced the denizens of #E Malolechowie#!, giving us protection from further expansion through the magical soulgem mines. Here the city of #E Starogod#! was established, its magic walls emerging from Mount Jelen.\n\nMany years have passed since the celestial deer graced our city, and since then #E Malolechowie#! has expanded her borders both into #E Lechii#! and #E Zechii#! lands. Recent victories embolden us. The winds have changed, and the Celestial Deer clearly is telling us it's time to expand further, and perhaps even reclaim our old homes we had lost centuries ago."
 zerywani_1_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when we have reestablished #E Zechie#!."
 zerywani_1_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Rise, children of #E Zehi#!, the chosen of #E Jelen#!."

#Missions

 zerywani_1_task_1:0 "Soul Forts"
 zerywani_1_task_1_DESC:0 "The #P Soulgem#! fort of Starogod is famous in our lands, and thus, we have studied them extensively. We should be able to use soulgems to create more powerful forts, although not as mighty as our famous Starogod's walls."
 
 zerywani_1_task_2:0 "Empower the Mages"
 zerywani_1_task_2_DESC:0 "Our #P Mage#! class has shrunk over time. The discipline is very difficult to master and outside of Starogod, it is near impossible to study it. We must grow the mage population in order to benefit from the magic passed down from the time of Zehi."
 
 zerywani_1_task_4:0 "Study Elven Magic"
 zerywani_1_task_4_DESC:0 "Although the #G Lesmians#! have often come in our way, we should send for any ambitious #G Lesmian#! scholars to come and study in Starogod."
 
 zerywani_1_task_3:0 "University of Jelen"
 zerywani_1_task_3_DESC:0 "Establishing a university of magic will put us in elite company in the world. Not many have our blessed and magical prowess, and it should attract to us even more mages to power our nation's administration."
 
 zerywani_1_task_5:0 "Our Younger Brothers"
 zerywani_1_task_5_DESC:0 "The #E Lechii#! have long been our perpetual younger brothers. Ever since #E Lehi#! and #E Zehi#! split, us #E Zechii#! have been blessed with knowledge, and they with martial prowess. As annoying as they can be, they deserve their own state, so let us establish such a brother client state."
 
 zerywani_1_task_6:0 "Winds of Change"
 zerywani_1_task_6_DESC:0 "The centralization and growth of our state is clearly a sign from Jelen herself that we must expand our influence. We will look East, West, and North to do so."
 
 zerywani_1_task_7:0 "Unite the Zechii"
 zerywani_1_task_7_DESC:0 "The unification of the kin of Zehi will empower our state in the most efficient way possible. Although Malolowii culture has improved significantly in the time it has had to develop on its own, our fellow Lechii will surely easily adopt our innovations."
 
 zerywani_1_task_8:0 "Reconquest of Old Zechie"
 zerywani_1_task_8_DESC:0 "The reconquest of the original land, Zechie, was a far dream for any of our people to concieve. But now, Jelen has spoken, and it is time to return to our ancestral homelands!"
 
 zerywani_1_task_9:0 "Punish the Alagurii"
 zerywani_1_task_9_DESC:0 "The #Y Alagurii#! once pushed our people out of their homes. And now, we shall punish them. They will be our workers and peasants, banned from advanced magics, and servants to our #Y Nobles#! and #Y Mages#!."
 
 zerywani_1_task_10:0 "Magic of Politics"
 zerywani_1_task_10_DESC:0 "The increasing influence of the #Y Mage#! class has started to influence our politics. By incorporating this into our national identity, we will be able to use this new influence to our advantage."
 
 zerywani_1_task_11:0 "Kingdom of Souls"
 zerywani_1_task_11_DESC:0 "Establishing the #E Kingdom of Souls#! would surely please mighty #Y Jelenia#!. In her name we conquered, and now with our victories behind us and dreams achieved, we should honor the mighty celestial deer as we have always done."
 
 zerywani_1_task_12:0 "City of Elixir"
 zerywani_1_task_12_DESC:0 "#E Napkor#!, a rather unimpressive place, apparently held value in the ancient times. And through another great blessing from #Y Jelenia#!, the produce of #E Napkor#! secretes important ingredients for #Y Elixir#! craft."
 
 zerywani_1_task_13:0 "Develop Elixir of Life"
 zerywani_1_task_13_DESC:0 "With an abundance of #Y Elixir#! produced in our borders, we may begin working on an #G Elixir of Life#!, which will heal our warriors at a speed unheard of this side of #E Mount Jelen#!."
 
 zerywani_1_task_14:0 "Develop Elixir of Harm"
 zerywani_1_task_14_DESC:0 "With an abundance of #Y Elixir#! produced in our borders, we may begin working on an #R Elixir of Harm#!, able to be used against our enemies, burning their skin, and improving our offensive capabilities."
 
 zerywani_1_task_15:0 "Develop Elixir of Soul"
 zerywani_1_task_15_DESC:0 "By combining the #Y Elixir#! crafting skills we have acquired with our #Y Soulgem#! technologies, we can create an #T Elixer of Soul#!, able to further strengthen our will itself!"
