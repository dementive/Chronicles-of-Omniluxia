 revant_heritage_desc:0 "A race of wraith-like people that bring darkness and destruction everywhere they go. Having recently emerged from the legendary chasm that was once thought to be entirely dormant and utterly uninhabitable, left at the heart of the world by the Great Collapse, these people loyally follow their leader 'The Revant' to their death. Although some who have met them on the battlefield say that death is not something that wraiths experience, and they simply rise again if they are struck down in battle..."

 revant.3.desc:0 "A dark cloud has appeared over the dissolved lands that were considered by many to be entirely devoid of any life and impossible to live on due to the catastrophic effects of the Great Collapse.\n\nThe legendary chasm at the heart of the world seems to be bleeding darkness; tales told by sailors in the area speak of endless hordes of wraith-like people who appear as nothing more than darkness to any unlucky enough to be close enough to see them. Tales have been told of this day all throughout Omniluxia ever since the Great Collapse. Stories tell of a legendary hero known only as #E 'The Revant'#! who spent his life fighting against the dark forces of magic, but on the fateful day of the Great Collapse, he, along with his loyal army, was cast into the chasm that formed when the world was nearly split in two.\n\nLegend says that the Revant did not die that day, and that one day when the light has left the world he would arise from the deep darkness and wreak havoc on the people of Omniluxia. Most did not believe these legends, but it seems that the day of reckoning has come...The Revant has arrived and all we can do now is hope that our people can avoid the endless hordes of darkness that have risen from the void."
