 03_dune1: "Reclaiming the Pomegranate Throne"
 03_dune1_DESCRIPTION: "Ever since the fall of the #E 30th Dynasty#! and the capture of [GetProvince('(int32)2805').GetName], the native #E Baetepians#! have never ruled more than small kingdoms in the #E Upper Baetep#!, subjects in their own homeland. While the #Y Lower Baetepians#! saw greater assimilation into #R Geallian#! society, the #Y Upper Baetepians#! under the new #E 31st Dynasty#!, the #E Djedhid#!, fiercly defended their independence, only seeing brief periods of subjugation.\n\nDespite their numerous attempts to retake their homelands, the various Upper Baetepian Kingdoms have failed to reclaim the #E Pomegranate Throne#!, as the occupying #R Geallian#! forces always fought fiercly to protect one of their most valuable provinces. However, the #E #R Invasions of Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!#! and the creation of the #R Sertemic Kingdom of Baetep#! have opened up a new opportunity for the inhabitants of the south.\n\nAllied together in a common cause, the once-rival states of [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] now seek to place [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] on the #E Pomegranate Throne#!!"

  me_dune_1_title: "An Avatar of the Gods"
  me_dune_1_desc: "Ever since the days of #E 23rd Dynasty#! the #E Pharons#! of the #E Baetep Kingdom#! have been avatars of the god #E #G Khewer#!#!, the rightful ruler and protector of the wealthy #E Lower Baetep#!! His authority has given the #E Djedhid#! dynasty the legitimacy it seeks to claim the #E #Y Pomegranate Throne#!#!.\n\nHowever, centuries have passed since the center of independent Baetepic power shifted from [GetProvince('(int32)2805').GetName] to [GetProvince('(int32)3735').GetName], and many religious advisors that surround the queen now claim that a different god now leads her people, a god of the #E Upper Baetep#!.\n\nThey advise the queen to host the god #E #G Senedejr#!#!, the one and only #E God of Gods, King of All#!, to help guide her in her quest to unite the #E Baetep#! under her rule.\n\nWhile hosting a new god would signal the start of a new prosperous age for the #E 31st Dynasty#!, it was the avatars of #E #G Khewer#!#! who reconquered the #E Baetep#! from foreign invaders.
