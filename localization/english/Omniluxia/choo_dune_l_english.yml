 03_dune1_DESCRIPTION: "Ever since the fall of the #E 30th Dynasty#! and the capture of [GetProvince('(int32)2805').GetName], the native #E Baetepians#! have never ruled more than small kingdoms in the #E Upper Baetep#!, subjects in their own homeland. While the #Y Lower Baetepians#! saw greater assimilation into #R Geallian#! society, the #Y Upper Baetepians#! under the new #E 31st Dynasty#!, the #E Djedhid#!, fiercly defended their independence, only seeing brief periods of subjugation.\n\nDespite their numerous attempts to retake their homelands, the various Upper Baetepian Kingdoms have failed to reclaim the provinces of #E Lower Baetep#!, as the occupying #R Geallian#! forces always fought fiercly to protect one of their most valuable provinces. However, the #E #R Invasions of Jarenam the Formidable Dragon#!#! and the unpopularity of the #R Sertemic Dynasty of Baetep#! have opened up a new opportunity for the inhabitants of the south.\n\nAllied together in a common cause, the once-rival states of [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] now seek to place [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] on the #E Pomegranate Throne#!!"

### EVENTS
  me_dune_1_title: "An Avatar of the Gods"
  me_dune_1_desc: "Ever since the days of #E 23rd Dynasty#! the #E Pharons#! of the #E Baetep Kingdom#! have been avatars of the god #E #G Khewer#!#!, the rightful ruler and protector of the wealthy #E Lower Baetep#!! His authority has given the #E Djedhid#! dynasty the legitimacy it seeks to claim the #E #Y Pomegranate Throne#!#!.\n\nHowever, centuries have passed since the center of independent Baetepic power shifted from [GetProvince('(int32)2805').GetName] to [GetProvince('(int32)3735').GetName], and many religious advisors that surround the queen now claim that a different god now leads her people, a god of the #E Upper Baetep#!.\n\nThey advise the queen to host the god #E #G Senedejr#!#!, the one and only #E God of Gods, King of All#!, to help guide her in her quest to unite the #E Baetep#! under her rule.\n\nWhile hosting a new god would signal the start of a new prosperous age for the #E 31st Dynasty#!, it was the avatars of #E #G Khewer#!#! who reconquered the #E Baetep#! from foreign invaders. The queen ponders this question."

The #E Sertem#! have managed to stabilize their realm, and will use all the wealth of the #E Lower Baetep#! against us. We can only hope that the gods will deliver us victory, and that others might also prey on the foreign dogs."

  me_dune_2_tooltip: "#R We will declare war on the [GetCountry('EGY').GetName].#!"

  me_dune_3_title: "A Call to Arms"
  me_dune_3_desc: "My King, the #E 31st Dynasty#! calls for our aid!\n\nDespite our petty rivalry, the emergence of the #E #R Sertemic Kingdom of Baetep#!#! has posed both a threat and an opportunity we could no longer avoid. Through negotiations, Queen [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] has promised us rule over the #E Upper Baetep#! in exchange for our support in her struggle to reclaim the #E Pomegranate Throne#!. Thus, while we might not agree with the #E House of Djedhid#!, it is better to have a familiar enemy on the throne than a hostile foreigner.\n\nThrough our King's passionate oration as well as subtle display of force, the neighboring kingdoms of [GetCountry('AKH').GetName] and [GetCountry('PTH').GetName] have allied themselves to our cause, bolstering our numbers against the #E Sertemic#! threat!"
  me_dune_3.a: "The Sons of the Tetepan will fight alongside the True Pharon!"

Invading armies of both the [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] and [GetCountry('AGE').GetName] have crossed into our borders!\n\nWhile I understand it is preposterous to believe, Queen [GetCharacter('(int32)9').GetName] of the #E 31st Dynasty#! claims the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] under the pretext of being the #E True Pharon#! and descendants of the #E 30th Dynasty#! wiped out by #E #R Zanis the Great#!#! long ago. Alongside her are the #E Agaetepians#! as well as a coalition of the various other independent states of the #E Upper Baetep#! who have sworn fealty to her in exchange for land or wealth.\n\nThe #E Djedhid Family#! of the [GetCountry('DUN').GetName] have long been a thorn in the side of the #E #R Zani#!#! and later [GetCountry('EGA').GetName], who never managed to fully wipe them out.

The other, an ancient dynasty that claims to trace back to the #E 30th Dynasty of the Baetep#!, the last native dynasty before #E #R Zanic#!#! rule. For centuries their realm lay hidden away in the sand dunes, only now emerging to reclaim their throne alongside their allies.\n\nWhichever side wins this war, it is certain that it will have grand ramifications on the political landscape of #E Northern Luxterra#!!"

With their armies in the south fighting the stubborn [GetCountry('DUN').GetName], this would be an excellent time to strike and regain our control over such a wealthy province!"

Thus, it can only be certain that it is our duty to begin this holy #E Golden Crusade#!.\n\nOur eager knights await your command - glory to Hellas!"
  me_dune_8.a: "FOR HELLAS!"
