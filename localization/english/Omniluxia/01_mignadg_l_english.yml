03_mignadg: "The Fall of the Euryalean League"
03_mignadg_DESCRIPTION: "In the years following the #E Great Collapse#!, the lands of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] suffered greatly, with ruinous tsunamis destroying much of the civilizations of the #E Cental Omniluxian Sea#!.\n\nAs the battered #E Ular-Pria#! began to slowly rebuild the shattered pieces of their lives, an unscrupulous warlord on the island of #E Kraklaz#! conquered his broken kinsmen during their weakest hour and formed what is now known as the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] - a tyrannical monarchy ruled by [GetCountry('UPJ').GetRuler.GetName] that seeks to enslave nearby islands.\n\nAnd yet, the prophecies of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] tell of a [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] that would save [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] people in their time of need. Woe unto those that live to see such prophecies fulfilled!"
03_mignadg_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] builds a thalassocracy that defeats the perfidious forces of the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] and unites the #E Ular-Pria#! under one banner."

Our grand city casts long shadows over our nearby kinsmen, who desperately hope to emulate our ways for themselves, and rather than wage fruitless wars of aggression against each other, it has been decided that it is in everyone's interest that they recognize [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] as the supreme authority of a new confederacy, one led by the mighty nation of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName].\n\nThe three Tribal Chiefs traveled to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] in order to personally submit to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName], who commanded that four goblets of Eptelonian wine be brought before the gathered assembly."
