03_mignadg: "The Destruction of Siznl"
03_mignadg_DESCRIPTION: "In the years following the #E Great Collapse#!, the lands of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetCulture.GetName] suffered greatly, with ruinous tsunamis destroying much of the civilizations of the #E Cental Omniluxian Sea#!. The mighty Snakefolk that had once ruled over a massive Empire now found their strength reduced to two cities; [GetProvince('(int32)5607').GetName] on the southern island of #E Kraklaz#! and [GetProvince('(int32)5694').GetName] far to the northwest.\n\nAnd yet life must go on. But as the battered #E Ular-Pria#! began to slowly rebuild the shattered pieces of their lives, an unscrupulous warlord on the island of #E Kraklaz#! conquered his broken kinsmen during their weakest hour and formed what is now known as the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] - a tyrannical monarchy ruled by [GetCountry('UPJ').GetRuler.GetName] that seeks to enslave all other Snakefolk. Those fortunate enough to escape the growing power of the Euryaleans have naturally gone to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and the two cities stand in opposition to each other.\n\nThe pre-Collapse prophecies of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] sing of a time 'when there shall be two and then there shall be one', and the priestesses of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_vensyn').GetName] teach that this speaks of a great war between the last two cities of the Ular-Pria; either [GetProvince('(int32)5607').GetName] or [GetProvince('(int32)5694').GetName] will destroy the other. Woe unto those that live to see such prophecies fulfilled!"
03_mignadg_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] builds a thalassocracy that defeats the perfidious forces of the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] and unites the #E Ular-Pria#! under one banner."

03_mignadg_task_1_DESC: "The nearby isles that comprise the #E Austropetolian Archipelago#! would stand a better chance against #E Euryalean#! armies if we were united, and [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] believes that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] can persuade our kin to submit to our rule.\n\n#Y Conquering the nearby islands will bypass this mission.#!"

03_mignadg_task_2_DESC: "The beating heart of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is the ancestral home of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] family and is the pride and joy of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], who has vowed to leave [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] mark on the city. The important harbor district has been targeted for expansion, as the need for a navy to counter the might of [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] is dire."

03_mignadg_task_3: "Claiming The Central Coasts"
03_mignadg_task_3_DESC: "The time has come for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] to make good on the promises that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetSheHe] has made - we must stand against the growing tyrrany of the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] and stake our claims throughout the #E Austropetolian Archipelago#!."

03_mignadg_task_4: "The War Of The Snakes"
03_mignadg_task_4_DESC: "Word is spreading throughout nearby #E Wegalia#! and #E Eptelon#! of the brutal struggles between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] and [GetCountry('UPJ').GetRuler.GetName] to carve out their spheres of influence throughout the #E Austropetolian Archipelago#!.\n\n#E 'The War of the Snakes'#!, as it has come to be known abroad, is said to be one of the bloodiest and most savage wars ever fought amongst the Ular-Pria."

03_mignadg_task_5: "The Fall of Siznl"
03_mignadg_task_5_DESC: "After a difficult war with our enemies, the hour of retribution is at hand and our soldiers have made a request that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has granted them; they can completely sack the city of [GetProvince('(int32)5607').GetName]."

03_mignadg_task_6: "The Buccaneer's District"
03_mignadg_task_6_DESC: "The farmlands of nearby [GetProvince('(int32)5692').GetName] could provide even more vegetables @vegetables! than they currently do, but there is one prickly problem; the pirates that have unofficial control of the nearby port and its valuable hinterlands.\n\nAnd yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has proposed a solution; once the farmlands have been built in Mohr, then our engineers will construct a new district within for [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] for the displaced pirates to make their homes."

03_mignadg_task_7: "Gemstones And Galleys"
03_mignadg_task_7_DESC: "The jungles of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have an extensive cave network underground, running deep into the island where no Ular-Pria has dared to delve.\n\nAnd yet these dangerous subterranean grottoes are the source of the diamonds @gems! that have brought the city its wealth, and without them, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] would not be able to fund its construction schemes."

03_mignadg_task_8: "The Strait Of Greegroknlp"
03_mignadg_task_8_DESC: "The tiny islet of [GetProvince('(int32)5697').GetName] would serve as an excellent sister-port to the busy site of [GetProvince('(int32)5694').GetName], which has become practically overwhelmed due to the high volume of traffic it receives."

03_mignadg_task_9: "No Crimes Unforgotten"
03_mignadg_task_9_DESC: "In our wars against the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetRuler.GetName], [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was disappointed to see many #E Nagarajian#! mercenaries serving in the auxiliary forces of the tyrants ruling [GetProvince('(int32)5607').GetName]. In an effort to punish the cowardly northerners for contributing to our enemies, it has been decided that their islands must be taken!"

03_mignadg_task_10: "Empire Of Serpents"
03_mignadg_task_10_DESC: "The prophecies have come true - a mighty King has unified the scattered tribes of the Austropetolian islands into an Empire that will reclaim the long-lost glory of the Snakefolk! All hail [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] and all hail #Y 'The Empire of the Ular-Pria'#!!"

03_mignadg_task_11_DESC: "On the outskirts of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], there are jungles that are filled with valuable sugarcane @sugar! that we should consider exporting.\n\nWhen we have enough funds to do so, we should prioritize building vast latifundia for our serfs. Sugar is a rarity in foreign markets and yet we have it in abundance - we should capitalize upon this."

03_mignadg_task_12: "The Silk Roads"
03_mignadg_task_12_DESC: "Thanks to our steady exports of silk @silk! and sugar @sugar!, we can afford to build roads that will connect [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] to the plantations and ports in its hinterlands. There will be some expenditure involved, but it will be well worth the investment."

03_mignadg_task_13: "Grand Market of Iprnk"
03_mignadg_task_13_DESC: "Although many foreign merchants will not sail deep within the Austropetolian Archipelago, they will overcome their natural fear of the Ular-Pria and travel to the majestic market built at the city of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName]."

The best sailors within all of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] are to be found within our fair city now, and our ships that sail from our harbor are filled with experienced boathands."

me_mignadg_5_desc: "By the time that the armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] had landed on the island of #E Kraklaz#!, the war with [GetCountry('UPJ').GetName] was a foregone conclusion - there was nothing in all of Omniluxia that could keep our levies from storming the walls of the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetAdjective] capital.\n\nRumors of the vast wealth of the [GetCountry('UPJ').GetAdjective] people motivated our soldiers to utterly destroy our enemies, and now that their so-called 'League' has been dissolved by an edict issued by [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName], the generous [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] unleashed [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetHerHis] armies upon the fallen Euryalean capital, telling them to plunder it to their heart's content in a speech delivered outside the army camps of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName].\n\n'Spare nothing, faithful sons of Mignadg, but gorge yourselves upon the corpse of this monstrosity!

No one wanted to anger the bold [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle], lest they find a gang of leering scoundrels at their doorstep one evening, cudgels in hand. "
