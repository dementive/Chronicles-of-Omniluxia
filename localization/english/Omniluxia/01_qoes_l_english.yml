03_qoes: "Scions of The Conquering King"
03_qoes_DESCRIPTION: "As the chaos of the #E Great Collapse#! toppled the Empires of #E Luxterra#!, a dwarven adventurer named #E Edis Dwanilo#! came down from the #E Skyreach Mountains#! with his kinsmen and fought against the tribes living on the #E Skyreach Steppes#!. After years of vicious warfare, the Copper Dwarves won a decisive battle against a combined Goblin and Selaskusian army and founded the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3816').GetName] at the foothill of the mountains.\n\nThe sturdy walls of Bad-Furqorin would protect the nascent Copper Dwarven kingdom in the years to come, but their enemies have never accepted their presence among them and eagerly await the moment that they can push them back into the hills."
03_qoes_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the Copper Dwarves of [GetCountry('SR4').GetName] have overcome their enemies and have established a mighty kingdom on the Skyreach Steppes."

03_qoes_task_1_DESC: "The hated Goblin tribes that live in the foothills of the #Y Skyreach Mountains#! have long been a thorn in the side of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], but their end rapidly approaches.

03_qoes_task_2: "Staving Off Famine"
03_qoes_task_2_DESC: "If only our people could eat the cinnabar taken from the mines at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y]! Food security has always been a problem for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] kinsmen, and as heightened tensions in the region are beginning to constrict the food supplies, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will be forced to attack our neighbors in order to keep our granaries full."

03_qoes_task_3_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has accomplished something that our glorious ancestor, #E Edis Dwanilo#!, fought for his entire life, but could never achieve - the pushing back of the Goblin Hordes and the expansion of our borders."

03_qoes_task_5_DESC: "Much to the chagrin of every Copper Dwarven farmer that lives near [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y], the fertile fields of the capital are an important source of cinnabar for the region.

03_qoes_task_6: "The Forum Of Edis"
03_qoes_task_6_DESC: "The inhabitants of [GetProvince('(int32)3816').GetName|Y] have long worshiped [GetDeityDefinition('omen_edis').GetName|G] at the holy site located within our city, and yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] believes that there is more we could do to honor our patron deity.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has called for a grand forum to be constructed outside of the religious district, one that will welcome the faithful to the City of the Qoes Dwarves.

03_qoes_task_8_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|Y] has long owed its survival to two things; the walls of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y] and the swords of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFamilyDisplayAdjective] Clan, both which have protected our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people since we first founded our city.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has made it known throughout [GetProvince('(int32)3816').GetName] that the time for military service draws near; if our people are to survive, then we shall have to fight for our lives."
