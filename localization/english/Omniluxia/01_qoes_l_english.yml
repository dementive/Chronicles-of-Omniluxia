03_qoes: "Scions of The Conquering King"
03_qoes_DESCRIPTION: "As the chaos of the #E Great Collapse#! toppled the Empires of #E Luxterra#!, a dwarven adventurer named #E Edis Dwanilo#! came down from the #E Skyreach Mountains#! with his kinsmen and fought against the tribes living on the #E Skyreach Steppes#!. After years of vicious warfare, the Copper Dwarves won a decisive battle against a combined Goblin and Selaskusian army and conquered the city of [GetProvince('(int32)3816').GetName] at the foothill of the mountains.\n\nThe sturdy walls of Bad-Furqorin would protect the nascent Copper Dwarven kingdom in the years to come, but their enemies have never accepted their presence among them and eagerly await the moment that they can push them back into the hills."
03_qoes_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when the Copper Dwarves of [GetCountry('SR4').GetName] have overcome their enemies and have established a mighty kingdom on the Skyreach Steppes."
03_qoes_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "We must complete the work that our ancestor Edis began!"

03_qoes_task_1_DESC: "The hated Goblin tribes that live in the foothills of the #Y Skyreach Mountains#! have long been a thorn in the side of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName], but their end rapidly approaches. Prepare our claims and gather our levies, for we shall cross through the pass near [GetProvince('(int32)3960').GetName] and dispel the Goblins from the province of [GetProvince('(int32)3960').GetArea.GetName|G]!"

03_qoes_task_2: "Staving Off Famine"
03_qoes_task_2_DESC: "If only our people could eat the cinnabar taken from the mines at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y]! Food security has always been a problem for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] kinsmen, and as heightened tensions in the region are beginning to constrict the food supplies, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will be forced to attack our neighbors in order to keep our granaries full."

03_qoes_task_3_DESC: "[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has accomplished something that our glorious forebear, #E Edis Dwanilo#!, could not - the pushing back of the Goblin Hordes and the rapid expansion of our borders."

03_qoes_task_5_DESC: "Much to the chagrin of every Copper Dwarven farmer that lives near [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y], the fertile fields of the capital are an important source of cinnabar for the region. Instead of harvesting grain with hand scythes, our laborers carry pickaxes into the mountains - let us make sure that their efforts are not in vain."

03_qoes_task_6: "The Forum of Edis"
03_qoes_task_6_DESC: "The inhabitants of [GetProvince('(int32)3816').GetName|Y] have long worshiped [GetDeityDefinition('omen_edis').GetName|G] in the Temple located within their city, and yet [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] believes that there is more we could do to honor our patron deity.\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] has called for a grand forum to be constructed outside of the religious district, one that will welcome the faithful to the City of the Goblinslayer."
