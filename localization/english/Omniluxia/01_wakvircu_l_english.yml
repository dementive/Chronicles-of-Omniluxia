03_wakvircu: "The Stellaric Consortium"
03_wakvircu_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, long before the #E Great Collapse#! would bring ruin and devastation to those alive to witness it, it is believed that a #E Star from the East#! fell from the skies and landed in the #E Northstar Bay#!. This Star brought strange people with it, angelic beings that spoke in hushed voices and glowed with a soft light, and these pale creatures lived alongside our ancestors as gods and taught our people many things - most importantly, our #E Stellaric Religion#!. One day, the Visitors said that they must leave and that they would fade away with the morning dew, and it came to pass exactly as they said - they vanished into nothingness at daybreak, turning into motes of light that dissipated like a dream.\n\nFor many centuries, we have lived peacefully, protected by the #E Tayngvw Mountains#! that circle our cities like an impregnable wall. Our civilization has thrived, especially when compared to our neighbors, but infighting amongst our Senators has weakened our position at the worst possible time, for the #R Blood-Stained#! religion is rapidly spreading to our north and we fear for our way of life in the face of their aggression."
03_wakvircu_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has reinvigorated its regional economy through investment and war and has formed the #E Stellaric Consortium#!."
03_wakvircu_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "The scales are perfectly balanced, yet one false move could destroy everything that we have accomplished..."

03_wakvircu_task_9_DESC: "The Oligarchs living within [GetCountry('DR8').GetName|T] have abandoned the safety provided by the #Y Tayngvw Mountains#!, choosing instead to build their cities in the forests and plains of #E Central Errnorfallie#!.

03_wakvircu_task_11: "Lokvir Province"
03_wakvircu_task_11_DESC: "There are some trade goods, like stone and horses, that are frustratingly common in many other realms yet remain scarce for us. The unfortunate reality of our position has forced us to invade the forested foothills of the province of [GetProvince('(int32)1938').GetArea.GetName|Y], for we cannot afford to be without these essentials for civilization."

03_wakvircu_task_12: "Restore The Guildhouses"
03_wakvircu_task_12_DESC: "For about eighty years, the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] was ruled by cabal of rebellious Senators that took arms against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] state in a brazen display of treasonous defiance, and during those dark days of corruption and misery, the ancient #Y Stellaric Guildhouses#! - the heart of the Old City, buildings with religious and historic significance for our people - have fallen into a pitiful state.\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has vowed to restore the Guildhouses to their previous glory."

03_wakvircu_task_14_DESC: "Now that we have possession of the Lokvir province, with its abundant resources of stone and horses, we must do everything we can to increase production of these goods.

03_wakvircu_task_15: "Plugging The Cracks"
03_wakvircu_task_15_DESC: "Although it will require a tremendous effort, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wants to construct earthworks that run from the foothills of the #E Tayngvw Mountains#! to our fortifications in [GetProvince('(int32)1740').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)1779').GetName|T].\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] believes that shaping the battlefield in this manner this will keep our people eternally safe from the threat of invasion, although some within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] are questioning the wisdom and practicality of this idea."

03_wakvircu_task_16: "Followers Of The Star"
03_wakvircu_task_16_DESC: "We have heard the disturbing reports emanating from [GetProvince('(int32)1718').GetName|T]; rumors of #R Blood-Stained#! raiding parties sweeping out of the northern mountains, armed with #E Drow#! steel and showing no mercy to prisoners, women and children alike. Although we have occasionally quarreled with [GetCountry('GS1').GetName|T] over the years, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] does not wish to see a Stellaric neighbor fall to the barbarous hordes that now press against their borders. "

03_wakvircu_task_17: "Brilliant Beryls And Bloody Brandy"
03_wakvircu_task_17_DESC: "The #R Bloody Peninsula#! is known for two things, primarily; the brilliant red beryls that can only be found at [GetProvince('(int32)1814').GetName|T] and the potent brandy that is brewed in the distilleries of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1879').GetName|T]. Now that we have these territories within our possession, the Guilds are requesting that we invest in the production of these tradegoods."

03_wakvircu_task_18: "Honor Among Thieves"
03_wakvircu_task_18_DESC: "The pirates that have plagued our shipping in the #Y Errfalian Sea#! should perhaps not be viewed as competitors and nuisances, but as potential friends - should we turn a blind eye to their activities as long as they promise to ignore our ships?\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] believes so, and has proposed an unorthodox solution to a perennial problem. Preliminary messages have been sent to the pirates from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and they are interested in hearing what else [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has to say."
 
03_wakvircu_task_19: "The Sea Elf Priestess"
03_wakvircu_task_19_DESC: "An elegant ship from the islands of the #G Sea Elves#! sailed into the port at [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] this morning, causing a commotion in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] capital that has not been seen in some time.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!"

03_wakvircu_task_21_DESC: "For hundreds of years, our ships have patrolled the waters of the #E Northstar Bay#! in order to keep the trading lanes free of pirates, but the reputation of the #G Stellaric Guildmasters#! suffered greatly when [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] declared independence.

03_wakvircu_task_22_DESC: "The Senators living in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have been left to their own devices for too many years, and as a result of their negligence and greed, civic matters within our country have been choked by corruption.

03_wakvircu_task_23_DESC: "Many of the coins that are collected by the treasurers living within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] have been debased with impurities, and the Guildmasters are demanding that a new currency be issued."

03_wakvircu_task_24: "Establish Foreign Embassies"
03_wakvircu_task_24_DESC: "Who can deny that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] is the seat of power of a mighty nation? Across all of Omniluxia, the name of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is spoken with reverence, for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] is one of the strongest political leaders in the entire world. Although it will be an expensive undertaking, we must establish embassies in the capital cities of the empires of Omniluxia."

03_wakvircu_task_25: "Disband The Council Of Guilds"
03_wakvircu_task_25_DESC: "As our borders expand, it has become increasingly unwieldly for a deliberative body, such as the Senate, to properly manage our internal affairs. It has been proposed that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] assumes direct control over the government; an idea that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] seems amenable to."
