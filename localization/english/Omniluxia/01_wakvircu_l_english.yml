03_wakvircu_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, long before the #E Great Collapse#! would bring ruin and misery to those alive to witness it, it is believed that a #E Star from the East#! fell from the skies and landed in the #E Northstar Bay#!. This Star brought strange people with it, angelic beings that spoke in hushed voices and glowed with a soft light, and these pale creatures lived alongside our ancestors as gods and taught our people many things - most importantly, our #E Stellaric Religion#!. One day, the Visitors said that they must leave and that they would fade away with the morning dew, and it came to pass exactly as they said - they vanished into nothingness at daybreak, turning into motes of light that dissipated like a dream.\n\nFor many centuries, we have lived peacefully, protected by the #E Tayngvw Mountains#! that circle our cities like an impregnable well. Our civilization has thrived in our "

#Missions

03_wakvircu_task_1: "Courting The Guildmasters"
03_wakvircu_task_1_DESC: "About eighty years ago, a dispute between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s great-grandfather and the #T Stellaric Guildmasters#! of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] over tax receipts caused the city to declare its independence from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|Y]. These pointless arguments have gone on long enough, however, and it is time that we attempt to mend this rift.\n\n#Y This task will be#! #R bypassed#! #Y if we already own#! #G Cuwa#!."
send_a_gift_to_cuwa_tt: "#Y We must send a#! #G Gift#! #Y to the city of#! #T Cuwa#!."

03_wakvircu_task_2: "The Triumphant Reunification"
03_wakvircu_task_2_DESC: "Now that we have brought the rebellious citizens of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] back into the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] fold, the time has come for us to move our capital from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y] back to the majestic city on the coasts where it belongs."

03_wakvircu_task_3: "The Northstar Armada"
03_wakvircu_task_3_DESC: "If we hope to expand our control over the trade routes of the #E Errfalian Sea#!, then we must have a proper navy that is well-trained and staffed with the best sailors that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can produce."
we_need_astral_navigation_tech: "#Y We need the invention#! #T Astral Navigation#!."
we_need_norrfallian_seafarers_path_1_tt: "#Y We need the#! #T Norrfallian Naval Ships#! #G Northerner Military Tradition#!."

03_wakvircu_task_4: "Harbor District Of Cuwa"
03_wakvircu_task_4_DESC: "Omens have been taken, and the #T Priests of#! #G [GetDeityDefinition('omen_ying_pin').GetName]#! have shared the will of the gods with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - the holy site for Ying-Pin must be moved from [GetProvince('(int32)1830').GetName|T] to [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T]. The #Y Commander of Storms#! desires his shrine be placed within the Harbor District of our capital, so that his presence can be felt by our people."

03_wakvircu_task_5: "Stellaric Stained Glass"
03_wakvircu_task_5_DESC: "There are two trade goods that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] excel at producing; dyes and glass. It has been proposed by the master craftsmen living at [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|Y] that we combine our two most famous luxury items and begin producing #T Stained Glass#! within the capital workshops."
we_need_transaction_taxation_policy_tt: "#Y We need the#! #T Economic Policy#! #G Transaction Taxation#! #Y active#!."

03_wakvircu_task_6: "Closing The Tayngvw Gates"
03_wakvircu_task_6_DESC: "Although the province of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetArea.GetName|G] is naturally protected by the #Y Tayngvw Mountains#!, there are two overland routes into the Stellaric heartland that many foreign armies have marched through. In order to safeguard our borders from the threat of our neighobrs, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has demanded that fortifications be built at [GetProvince('(int32)1740').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)1779').GetName|T]."
we_need_improved_fortification_tt: "#Y We need the#! #T Economic Policy#! #G Improved Fortifications#! #Y active#!."

03_wakvircu_task_7: "Stellaric Soldiers Of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_renjun').GetName]"
03_wakvircu_task_7_DESC: "Before we can hope to humble our enemies on the battlefield, then we must overhaul the army and tactics; not only must our nobility lead our forces, but we must have manpower reserves on hand to replenish the soldiers that we lose in battle. May #T Renjuun#! bring glory to our warriors!"
renjun_omen_active_tt: "#Y The deity#! #T Renjuun#! #Y must be active within our#! #G Pantheon#!."

03_wakvircu_task_8: "Claiming The Consortium"
03_wakvircu_task_8_DESC: "Although there are many kingdoms and tribes that will oppose our expansion into the #R Bloody Peninsula#!, the armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will not be deterred from conquering what is rightfully ours. There are many valuable resources in the lands to our south that we will need in order to establish the #T Stellaric Consortium#!."

03_wakvircu_task_9: "Courting [GetCountry('DR8').GetAdjective|E]"
03_wakvircu_task_9_DESC: "The Oligarchs living within [GetCountry('DR8').GetName|T] have abandoned the safety provided by the #Y Tayngvw Mountains#!, choosing instead to build their cities in the forests and plains of #E Central Errnorfallie#!. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is convinced that we can persuade our distant cousins to submit to the authority of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|T] as long as we guarantee their rights - the #G Stellaric Faithful#! must be united!"
send_a_gift_to_dr8_tt: "#Y We must send a#! #G Gift#! #Y to the city of#! #T Cuskedot#!."

03_wakvircu_task_10: "A Call For Colonists"
03_wakvircu_task_10_DESC: "There are large swathes of territory within #Y Central#! and #Y Northern Ernorrfalie#! that are unclaimed by the settled tribes living on the plains, and although this could change at any moment, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has proposed that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] treasuries pay for settlers to go inhabit these lands."

03_wakvircu_task_11: "Lokvir Province"
03_wakvircu_task_11_DESC: "There are some trade goods, like stone and horses, that are frustratingly common in many other realms yet remain scarce for us. The unfortunate reality of our position has forced us to invade the forested foothills of the province of [GetProvince('(int32)1938').GetArea.GetName|Y], for we cannot afford to be without these essentials for civilization."

03_wakvircu_task_12: "Restore The Guildhouses"
03_wakvircu_task_12_DESC: "For about eighty years, the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] was ruled by cabal of rebellious Senators that took arms against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] state in a brazen display of treasonous defiance, and during those dark days of corruption and misery, the ancient #E Stellaric Guildhouses#! - the heart of the Old City, buildings with religious and historic significance for our people - have fallen into a pitiful state. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has vowed to restore the Guildhouses to their previous glory."

03_wakvircu_task_13: "Establish The Consortium"
03_wakvircu_task_13_DESC: "After a period of expensive warfare that drained the resources and will of the State and its citizens, we have finally managed to secure the land required to proclaim our #Y Stellaric Consortium#! - a religious and economic bulwark against the encroachments of the #R Bloodstained#! to our north and the #G Elemenics#! to the south."
you_need_to_form_stellaric_consortium_tt: "#Y We need to take the decision to#! #T Establish the Stellaric Consortium#!."
