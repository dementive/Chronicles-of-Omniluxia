03_wakvircu: "The Stellaric Guildmasters"
03_wakvircu_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, long before the #E Great Collapse#! would bring ruin and devastation to those alive to witness it, it is believed that a #E Star from the East#! fell from the skies and landed in the #E Northstar Bay#!. This Star brought strange people with it, angelic beings that spoke in hushed voices and glowed with a soft light, and these pale creatures lived alongside our ancestors as gods and taught our people many things - most importantly, our #E Stellaric Religion#!. One day, the Visitors said that they must leave and that they would fade away with the morning dew, and it came to pass exactly as they said - they vanished into nothingness at daybreak, turning into motes of light that dissipated like a dream.\n\nFor many centuries, we have lived peacefully, protected by the #E Tayngvw Mountains#! that circle our cities like an impregnable well. Our civilization has thrived, especially when compared to our neighbors, but infighting amongst our Senators has weakened our position at the worst possible time, for the #R Blood-Stained#! religion is rapidly spreading to our north and we fear for our way of life."
03_wakvircu_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has reinvigorated its regional economy through investment and war and has formed the #E Stellaric Consortium#!."

These pointless arguments have gone on long enough, however, and it is time that we attempt to mend this rift.\n\n#Y This task will be#! #R bypassed#! #Y if we already own#! #G Cuwa#!."

03_wakvircu_task_3_DESC: "If we hope to expand our control over the trade routes of the #E Errfalian Sea#!, then we must have a proper navy that is well-trained and staffed with the best sailors that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can produce."

03_wakvircu_task_5: "Stellaric Stained Glass"
03_wakvircu_task_5_DESC: "There are two trade goods that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] excel at producing; dyes and glass.

03_wakvircu_task_7_DESC: "Before we can hope to humble our enemies on the battlefield, then we must overhaul the army and tactics; not only must our nobility lead our forces, but we must have manpower reserves on hand to replenish the soldiers that we lose in battle.

03_wakvircu_task_9: "Courting [GetCountry('DR8').GetAdjective|E]"
03_wakvircu_task_9_DESC: "The Oligarchs living within [GetCountry('DR8').GetName|T] have abandoned the safety provided by the #Y Tayngvw Mountains#!, choosing instead to build their cities in the forests and plains of #E Central Errnorfallie#!.

03_wakvircu_task_10_DESC: "There are large swathes of territory within #Y Central#! and #Y Northern Ernorrfalie#! that are unclaimed by the settled tribes living on the plains, and although this could change at any moment, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has proposed that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] treasuries pay for settlers to go inhabit these lands."

03_wakvircu_task_11: "Lokvir Province"
03_wakvircu_task_11_DESC: "There are some trade goods, like stone and horses, that are frustratingly common in many other realms yet remain scarce for us. The unfortunate reality of our position has forced us to invade the forested foothills of the province of [GetProvince('(int32)1938').GetArea.GetName|Y], for we cannot afford to be without these essentials for civilization."

03_wakvircu_task_12: "Restore The Guildhouses"
03_wakvircu_task_12_DESC: "For about eighty years, the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] was ruled by cabal of rebellious Senators that took arms against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] state in a brazen display of treasonous defiance, and during those dark days of corruption and misery, the ancient #E Stellaric Guildhouses#! - the heart of the Old City, buildings with religious and historic significance for our people - have fallen into a pitiful state. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has vowed to restore the Guildhouses to their previous glory."

03_wakvircu_task_13: "Establish The Consortium"
03_wakvircu_task_13_DESC: "After a period of expensive warfare that drained the resources and will of the State and its citizens, we have finally managed to secure the land required to proclaim our #Y Stellaric Consortium#! - a religious and economic bulwark against the encroachments of the #R Blood-Stained#! to our north and the #G Elemenics#! to the south."

03_wakvircu_task_14: "Stone And Stallions"
03_wakvircu_task_14_DESC: "Now that we have possession of the Lokvir province, with its abundant resources of stone and horses, we must do everything we can to increase production of these goods.

03_wakvircu_task_15: "Plugging The Cracks"
03_wakvircu_task_15_DESC: "Although it will require a tremendous effort, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wants to construct earthworks that run from the foothills of the #E Tayngvw Mountains#! to our fortifications in [GetProvince('(int32)1740').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)1779').GetName|T].\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] believes that shaping the battlefield in this manner this will keep our people eternally safe from the threat of invasion, although some within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] are questioning the wisdom and practicality of this idea."

03_wakvircu_task_16: "Followers Of The Star"
03_wakvircu_task_16_DESC: "We have heard the disturbing reports emanating from [GetProvince('(int32)1718').GetName|T]; rumors of #R Blood-Stained#! raiding parties sweeping out of the northern mountains, armed with #E Drow#! steel and showing no mercy to prisoners, women and children alike. Although we have occasionally quarreled with [GetCountry('GS1').GetName|T] over the years, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] does not wish to see a Stellaric neighbor fall to the barbarous hordes that now press against their borders. "

03_wakvircu_task_17: "Brilliant Beryls And Bloody Brandy"
03_wakvircu_task_17_DESC: "The #R Bloody Peninsula#! is known for two things, primarily; the brilliant red beryls that can only be found at [GetProvince('(int32)1814').GetName|T] and the potent brandy that is brewed in the distilleries of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1879').GetName|T]. Now that we have these territories within our possession, the Guilds are requesting that we invest in the production of these tradegoods."

03_wakvircu_task_18: "Honor Among Thieves"
03_wakvircu_task_18_DESC: "The pirates that have plagued our shipping in the #Y Errfalian Sea#! should perhaps not be viewed as competitors and nuisances, but as potential friends - should we turn a blind eye to their activities as long as they promise to ignore our ships?\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] believes so, and has proposed an unorthodox solution to a perennial problem. Preliminary messages have been sent to the pirates from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and they are interested in hearing what else [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has to say."
 
03_wakvircu_task_19: "The Sea Elf Captain"
03_wakvircu_task_19_DESC: "A battered barque from the islands of the #G Sea Elves#! limped into the port at [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] this morning, causing a commotion in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] capital that has not been seen in some time.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!"

03_wakvircu_task_20_DESC: "[GetCountry('GS2').GetRuler.GetName|T] has written a distressing letter to [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] that asks for the aid of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] people.\n\nThey have expressed a willingness to submit to the authority of the #G Stellaric Guildmasters#!, but even though they are afraid of their enemies and in a desperate situation, they still hoping to profit from the situation. Their [GetCountry('GS2').GetRulerTitle] has said that [GetCountry('GS2').GetName|T] will become our #Y Client State#! if we agree to build them a #Y City#! where their capital, [GetProvince('(int32)1860').GetName|T], is located."

03_wakvircu_task_21: "Clearing The Sea Lanes"
03_wakvircu_task_21_DESC: "For hundreds of years, our ships have patrolled the waters of the #E Northstar Bay#! in order to keep the trading lanes free of pirates, but the reputation of the #G Stellaric Guildmasters#! suffered greatly when [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] declared independence. The time has come to reassert our position as the preeminent naval power in the region - trade will flourish unimpeded under our watchful eyes."

me_wakvircu_20_desc: "Although some of the Senators living at [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] were incensed at the audacity of [GetCountry('GS2').GetRuler.GetName]'s request, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] was one of the few that did not mind the boldness of the [GetCountry('GS2').GetRulerTitle], but rather, found [GetCountry('GS2').GetRuler.GetHerHis] crude honesty refreshing.\n\nThe [GetCountry('GS2').GetAdjective] people have obviously heard of our wealth and influence, and although we share the same beliefs, our kinsmen from across the mountains basically live in squalor - their settlements are primitive affairs, as they spend most of their time riding horses and hunting. They do not have the funds or the means to construct their own city, so asking for our [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] engineers to make the journey to [GetProvince('(int32)1860').GetName] assist them seems like a small price to pay for their acknowledgment of our authority over them."
