03_wakvircu: "The Stellaric Guildmasters"
03_wakvircu_DESCRIPTION: "Hundreds of years ago, long before the #E Great Collapse#! would bring ruin and devastation to those alive to witness it, it is believed that a #E Star from the East#! fell from the skies and landed in the #E Northstar Bay#!. This Star brought strange people with it, angelic beings that spoke in hushed voices and glowed with a soft light, and these pale creatures lived alongside our ancestors as gods and taught our people many things - most importantly, our #E Stellaric Religion#!. One day, the Visitors said that they must leave and that they would fade away with the morning dew, and it came to pass exactly as they said - they vanished into nothingness at daybreak, turning into motes of light that dissipated like a dream.\n\nFor many centuries, we have lived peacefully, protected by the #E Tayngvw Mountains#! that circle our cities like an impregnable well. Our civilization has thrived, especially when compared to our neighbors, but infighting amongst our Senators has weakened our position at the worst possible time, for the #R Blood-Stained#! religion is rapidly spreading to our north and we fear for our way of life."
03_wakvircu_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION: "This mission will be completed when [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] has reinvigorated its regional economy through investment and war and has formed the #E Stellaric Consortium#!."
03_wakvircu_BUTTON_TOOLTIP: "The scales are perfectly balanced, yet one false move could destroy everything that we have accomplished..."

#Missions

03_wakvircu_task_1: "Courting The Cuwans"
03_wakvircu_task_1_DESC: "About eighty years ago, a dispute between [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName]'s great-grandfather and the #T Stellaric Guildmasters#! of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] over tax receipts caused the city to declare its independence from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|Y]. These pointless arguments have gone on long enough, however, and it is time that we attempt to mend this rift.\n\n#Y This task will be#! #R bypassed#! #Y if we already own#! #G Cuwa#!."
send_a_gift_to_cuwa_tt: "#Y We must send a#! #G Gift#! #Y to the city of#! #T Cuwa#!."

03_wakvircu_task_2: "The Triumphant Reunification"
03_wakvircu_task_2_DESC: "Now that we have brought the rebellious citizens of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] back into the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] fold, the time has come for us to move our capital from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName|Y] back to the majestic city on the coasts where it belongs."

03_wakvircu_task_3: "The Northstar Armada"
03_wakvircu_task_3_DESC: "If we hope to expand our control over the trade routes of the #E Errfalian Sea#!, then we must have a proper navy that is well-trained and staffed with the best sailors that [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] can produce."
we_need_astral_navigation_tech: "#Y We need the invention#! #T Astral Navigation#!."
we_need_norrfallian_seafarers_path_1_tt: "#Y We need the#! #T Norrfallian Naval Ships#! #G Northerner Military Tradition#!."

03_wakvircu_task_4: "Harbor District Of Cuwa"
03_wakvircu_task_4_DESC: "Omens have been taken, and the #T Priests of#! #G [GetDeityDefinition('omen_ying_pin').GetName]#! have shared the will of the gods with [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] - the holy site for Ying-Pin must be moved from [GetProvince('(int32)1830').GetName|T] to [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T]. The #Y Commander of Storms#! desires his shrine be placed within the Harbor District of our capital, so that his presence can be felt by our people."

03_wakvircu_task_5: "Stellaric Stained Glass"
03_wakvircu_task_5_DESC: "There are two trade goods that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] excel at producing; dyes and glass. It has been proposed by the master craftsmen living at [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|Y] that we combine our two most famous luxury items and begin producing #T Stained Glass#! within the capital workshops."
we_need_transaction_taxation_policy_tt: "#Y We need the#! #T Economic Policy#! #G Transaction Taxation#! #Y active#!."

03_wakvircu_task_6: "Closing The Tayngvw Gates"
03_wakvircu_task_6_DESC: "Although the province of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetArea.GetName|G] is naturally protected by the #Y Tayngvw Mountains#!, there are two overland routes into the Stellaric heartland that many foreign armies have marched through. In order to safeguard our borders from the threat of our neighobrs, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has demanded that fortifications be built at [GetProvince('(int32)1740').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)1779').GetName|T]."
we_need_improved_fortification_tt: "#Y We need the#! #T Economic Policy#! #G Improved Fortifications#! #Y active#!."

03_wakvircu_task_7: "Stellaric Soldiers Of [GetDeityDefinition('omen_renjun').GetName]"
03_wakvircu_task_7_DESC: "Before we can hope to humble our enemies on the battlefield, then we must overhaul the army and tactics; not only must our nobility lead our forces, but we must have manpower reserves on hand to replenish the soldiers that we lose in battle. May #T Renjuun#! bring glory to our warriors!"
renjun_omen_active_tt: "#Y The deity#! #T Renjuun#! #Y must be active within our#! #G Pantheon#!."

03_wakvircu_task_8: "Claiming The Consortium"
03_wakvircu_task_8_DESC: "Although there are many kingdoms and tribes that will oppose our expansion into the #R Bloody Peninsula#!, the armies of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] will not be deterred from conquering what is rightfully ours. There are many valuable resources in the lands to our south that we will need in order to establish the #T Stellaric Consortium#!."

03_wakvircu_task_9: "Courting [GetCountry('DR8').GetAdjective|E]"
03_wakvircu_task_9_DESC: "The Oligarchs living within [GetCountry('DR8').GetName|T] have abandoned the safety provided by the #Y Tayngvw Mountains#!, choosing instead to build their cities in the forests and plains of #E Central Errnorfallie#!. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] is convinced that we can persuade our distant cousins to submit to the authority of [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName|T] as long as we guarantee their rights - the #G Stellaric Faithful#! must be united!"
send_a_gift_to_dr8_tt: "#Y We must send a#! #G Gift#! #Y to the city of#! #T Cuskedot#!."

03_wakvircu_task_10: "A Call For Colonists"
03_wakvircu_task_10_DESC: "There are large swathes of territory within #Y Central#! and #Y Northern Ernorrfalie#! that are unclaimed by the settled tribes living on the plains, and although this could change at any moment, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has proposed that the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] treasuries pay for settlers to go inhabit these lands."

03_wakvircu_task_11: "Lokvir Province"
03_wakvircu_task_11_DESC: "There are some trade goods, like stone and horses, that are frustratingly common in many other realms yet remain scarce for us. The unfortunate reality of our position has forced us to invade the forested foothills of the province of [GetProvince('(int32)1938').GetArea.GetName|Y], for we cannot afford to be without these essentials for civilization."

03_wakvircu_task_12: "Restore The Guildhouses"
03_wakvircu_task_12_DESC: "For about eighty years, the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] was ruled by cabal of rebellious Senators that took arms against the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] state in a brazen display of treasonous defiance, and during those dark days of corruption and misery, the ancient #E Stellaric Guildhouses#! - the heart of the Old City, buildings with religious and historic significance for our people - have fallen into a pitiful state. [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] has vowed to restore the Guildhouses to their previous glory."

03_wakvircu_task_13: "Establish The Consortium"
03_wakvircu_task_13_DESC: "After a period of expensive warfare that drained the resources and will of the State and its citizens, we have finally managed to secure the land required to proclaim our #Y Stellaric Consortium#! - a religious and economic bulwark against the encroachments of the #R Blood-Stained#! to our north and the #G Elemenics#! to the south."
you_need_to_form_stellaric_consortium_tt: "#Y We need to take the decision to#! #T Establish the Stellaric Consortium#!."

03_wakvircu_task_14: "Stone And Stallions"
03_wakvircu_task_14_DESC: "Now that we have possession of the Lokvir province, with its abundant resources of stone and horses, we must do everything we can to increase production of these goods. Not only must we invest in the local infrastructure, but we must also ensure that the quarries and stables of our new territories are filled with hard-working laborers."

03_wakvircu_task_15: "Plugging The Cracks"
03_wakvircu_task_15_DESC: "Although it will require a tremendous effort, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] wants to construct earthworks that run from the foothills of the #E Tayngvw Mountains#! to our fortifications in [GetProvince('(int32)1740').GetName|T] and [GetProvince('(int32)1779').GetName|T].\n\nThe [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRulerTitle] believes that shaping the battlefield in this manner this will keep our people eternally safe from the threat of invasion, although some within [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName] are questioning the wisdom and practicality of this idea."

03_wakvircu_task_16: "Followers Of The Star"
03_wakvircu_task_16_DESC: "We have heard the disturbing reports emanating from [GetProvince('(int32)1718').GetName|T]; rumors of #R Blood-Stained#! raiding parties sweeping out of the northern mountains, armed with #E Drow#! steel and showing no mercy to prisoners, women and children alike. Although we have occasionally quarrled with [GetCountry('GS1').GetName|T] over the years, [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName|Y] does not wish to see a Stellaric neighbor fall to the barbarous hordes that now press against their borders. "

03_wakvircu_task_17: "Brilliant Beryls And Bloody Brandy"
03_wakvircu_task_17_DESC: "The #R Bloody Peninsula#! is known for two things, primarily; the brilliant red beryls that can only be found at [GetProvince('(int32)1814').GetName|T] and the potent brandy that is brewed in the distilleries of the city of [GetProvince('(int32)1879').GetName|T]. Now that we have these territories within our possession, the Guilds are requesting that we invest in the production of these tradegoods."

03_wakvircu_task_18: "Honor Among Thieves"
03_wakvircu_task_18_DESC: "The pirates that have plagued our shipping in the #Y Errfalian Sea#! should perhaps not be viewed as competitors and nuisances, but as potential friends - should we turn a blind eye to their activities as long as they promise to ignore our ships?\n\n[ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetName] believes so, and has proposed an unorthodox solution to a perennial problem. Preliminary messages have been sent to the pirates from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetCapital.GetName], and they are interested in hearing what else [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetFirstName] has to say."
 
03_wakvircu_task_19: "The Sea Elf Captain"
03_wakvircu_task_19_DESC: "A battered barque from the islands of the #G Sea Elves#! limped into the port at [GetProvince('(int32)1849').GetName|T] this morning, causing a commotion in the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetAdjective] capital that has not been seen in some time.\n\n#Y This will start an event chain.#!"
