 stellaric_missions:0 "The Starry Night Sky"
 stellaric_missions_DESCRIPTION:0 "Since the times of long ago, the Adhmhuchi tribes were blessed with the revelation of the Fallen Star, or the Stellaric belief. Their location at the #E Starside Shore#! has been home to many invasions from the Eastern Continent. Some of them were repelled like the #E High Elves#!, yet others like the so called #E Stellaric Foreigners#! were on a mission other than displacement of the natives. They would teach the natives the truth of the world before dissapearing into the stars.\n\nThe time has come for the Stellaric believers to come together and shine like the bright star they can be. Like the #E Stellaric Foreigners#! of old, the message of #E Szing-Szing#! will reach new lands."
 stellaric_missions_CRITERIA_DESCRIPTION:0 "This mission will be completed when the light of the stars has reached all of Luxterra."
 stellaric_missions_BUTTON_TOOLTIP:0 "Rise like the morning star."

#Missions

 stellaric_missions_1:0 "Unify the True Believers"
 stellaric_missions_1_DESC:0 "Differences amongst the specific beliefs of Stellaricism have lead to the formation of competing cults. Before we can even think to spread our message, we must unify into one consice entity."

 stellaric_missions_2:0 "Patronize Szing-Szing"
 stellaric_missions_2_DESC:0 "The patron of the night sky, Szing-Szing is the most popular of deities. As the universal leader of all godlike and enlightened beings, a representative of Szing-Szing will be chosen to lead the nation."

 stellaric_missions_3:0 "Patronize Ri-Szing"
 stellaric_missions_3_DESC:0 "The less popular younger brother of Szing-Szing, Ri-Szing is the morning star. The more violent nature of his teachings has made him less important in the relatively peaceful Starside Shore. However, as a new era unfolds, perhaps his teachings will become more useful."

 stellaric_missions_4:0 "Patronize Yow-Pin"
 stellaric_missions_4_DESC:0 "The lady of medicines, Yow-Pin is a devisive figure. While important, she was also infamous for giving birth to only monsters and was banished. Reviving this cult will emphasize monster-worship, and a more tribal way of life."

 stellaric_missions_5:0 "Patronize Ying-Pin"
 stellaric_missions_5_DESC:0 "The great north star, Ying-Pin is the son of Yow-Pin and the patron of sailors. Patronizing him will give us an emphasis on mercantile trade and naval tradition, so that the belief of the stars may spread across the coast of eastern Luxterra, or perhaps even further distances."

 stellaric_missions_6:0 "Patronize Tarra"
 stellaric_missions_6_DESC:0 "The goddess of the Bloodmoon, Tarra is especially popular amongst women. Patronizing her will surely bring the terror of the Bloodmoon."

 stellaric_missions_7:0 "Patronize Szi-Lia"
 stellaric_missions_7_DESC:0 "The god of the Blue Moon, Szi-Lia is especially popular amongst men. The normalization of sexual endeavors means that we will be able to quickly establish and promote colonies and settlements."

 stellaric_missions_8:0 "Patronize Zwizhu"
 stellaric_missions_8_DESC:0 "The most prominent and different cult amongst the Stellaric Cults is that of Zwizhu "The Finality." Zwizhu was the first and last being in the world and that is the way the universe will forever go. Our mission is to bring the universe towards the finality."
