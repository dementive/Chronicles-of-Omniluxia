 GCS_TREE: "$GCS$$HAS_TREE$\n\nFor hundreds of years, the #G Stellaric Guildmasters#! have controlled the shipping routes throughout the #T Errfalian Sea#!, and their reputation as fair and honest brokers of trade is highly regarded throughout all of Omniluxia.\n\nRecently, however, infighting amongst the Senators and leading noble families living near the #G Northstar Bay#! has caused the city of #T Cuwa#!, ancient home of the all-powerful Stellaric Guildhouses, to declare its independence from #Y Wakvircu#!, and there are fears that these petty divisions will cause the entire province to fall to the #R Blood-Stained#! armies."
 EGY_TREE: "$EGY$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nTaking advantage of the weakened Razani and the death of Jarenam the Formidable, the House of Sertem has become the first independent dynasty of Baetep since its conquest by the Zani Empire centuries ago. The Sertem, during Zani rule, rose to prominence by being administrators and governors over the Imperial province of Baetep. Early converts to the Zanisite faith, they were granted special privileges that placed them in an ideal position to claim control of Baetep from the crumbling empires around them. With the reins of such a wealthy realm firmly in their control, the Sertem could easily turn their kingdom into one of the great powers of Omniluxia."
 ZAK_TREE: "$ZAK$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Zarakens of the Kyaxares are much older than the fallen Zakara Kephal, with the pre-Zainudian Zaraken Empire once rivaling even the Zani Empire at their height. However, after the fall of both their empires and the slaughter of their royal family, the Zaraken rump state that now exists is but a pale imitation of their former glory. Despised by all their neighbors and considered heretics for their association with Helluvians by many of the Zainudian faithful, the Zarakens of Kyaxares must ascend or face oblivion."
 DE3_TREE: "$DE3$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Drow, also known as 'Dark Elves', are among the many ancient races of Omniluxia. Stories as old as time tell tales of the origin of these strange elves; it is said that at one point they looked and behaved just like the High Elves of #Y Horteon#!. Records speak of a small contingency of High Elves who departed from Horteon for more fruitful lands and, after sailing for years, they finally settled deep in the mountains of Northeast Luxterra."
 IT8_TREE: "$IT8$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Zewggad Republic sits at the mouth of the Intermarenican Sea on the island of Marenica. Because of this, it has poetically been said that all boats eventually lead to Marenica, which is home to some of the greatest markets in the entire world. The Zewggad Republican system operates on wealth; money rules everything. The richest citizens naturally rule over everything, and this system has lead to the islanders having a reputation for being corrupt penny-pinchers and greed-obssessed fools, yet all acknowledge that their parsimonious ways have only helped the Zewggad prosper."
 GB4_TREE: "$GB4$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nGoblins can be found deep in the mountains of Omniluxia as far away from any trace of civilization as possible. Goblins are primitive beings as old as the world itself, known to many as the 'Scourge of Skyreach'. There are countless tales that recount the deadly ambushes and the ensuing slaughter told by any foolish enough to enter their domain. Their lives shortened by their pact with Melodias, Goblinic hordes are only made possible by their high fertility and large kinship groups."
 DUN_TREE: "$DUN$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Kingdom of Dune and its ruling Djedhid dynasty has stood strong as one of the longest-lasting noble houses in all of Omniluxia and are the true descendants of the Pharons of old. Their ancient realm of #Y Baetep#! is said to have been founded a thousand years before even the #T Gellaius Empire#!, but the armies of Zanis the Great destroyed their armies and sacked their capital, ending their rule. Forced to abandon the Imperial Palaces by the Tariku Pyramids, the Djedhid nobility fled southward to Usire Baetep, where they rule as Kings and Queens over a small remnant of their shattered Empire."
 LF6_TREE: "$LF6$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Deep Wood Elves profess to be the oldest and wisest of their kind - a claim that is vehemently denied by the High Elves. Few have seen their homelands, the pristine forests of eastern Luxterra that are nestled high within the mountains, for the Deep Elves are highly suspicious of outsiders, especially the warmongering Werhenlanders. They maintain semi-friendly relations with the Common Dwarves, but as a rule, they do not trust most humans."
 EGA_TREE: "$EGA$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe great Empire of the East, known to all as the Razani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of Unified Zani' or 'Empire of the United People.' The Razani Empire rose from the ashes of the Eastern half of the Zani Empire from the days of old. Unlike its counterpart to the west, the Razani Empire retains a 'purer' form of culture and often cites this as a tool of legitimacy against their rival-sibling to the west."
 WGA_TREE: "$WGA$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe great Empire of the West, known to all as the Nazani Empire. In the local language, it means 'Empire of the Rebirthed Zani' or 'Empire of the People Reborn.' The Nazani Empire is a remnant of the Zani Empire from the days of old, but, unlike her counterpart in the east, the Razani, the Nazani people intermarried with the local peoples and created the new 'Weageli' culture."
 SOV_TREE: "$SOV$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Sovenerians were once one of the many Dragkhan tribes surrounding the Dragon Mountains. When the Zani Empire split and the Nazani Empire found themselves busy dealing with the Marshlanders, the Sovenerians saw their chance and conquered the Zanic colonists who lived in the fertile plains of Kainaxarthos. While initially only interested in taxing their subjects, the Sovenerians began to adopt Zanic culture under Uttarasmake the Great, who even adopted the Helluvian religion of his Kainaxari subjects. Declaring himself an Emperor in the Zanic style, the Sovenerians now seek to emulate the Zani and aren't as cruel or ruthless as their Dragkhanic brothers. However, recent court intrigue and their new lifestyle have left the Soventeir Empire weak and vulnerable to civil war, uprisings, or destruction by more ambitious neighbors."
 ARL_TREE: "$ARL$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nSteadfast and brave, the Aralans people were Wildlander mercenaries employed by the Zani to secure and stabilize the Imperial province of Rohenoa from the unruly Rohenoans. Promised land in exchange for their services, they settled down and created small communities across Rohevia and Rohenoa. When the Zani abandoned the province, the Aralans were forced to fend for themselves, and while many swore fealty to one of the few Aralans kings, there were those who decided not to stick with their kinsmen to avoid the wars that engulfed the peninsula. These are the Aralans, who are loyal to themselves first and foremost."
 BRE_TREE: "$BRE$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Jodok Kings of #Y Bretagne#! have long fought off the encroachments of the #T Aralans#! - and despite their Zanic ancestry, there is no doubt that they are the only bulwark against Aralans domination. Both powers have struggled against each other for control over Rohenoa and Rohevia, while the native Rohenoans are often either helpless victims or forced to pick a side. Expert horsemen whose knights dominate the plains, the knights of the Jodok clan are unequalled when fighting on open ground."
 MH1_TREE: "$MH1$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nThe Myahudan Kingdom was once a loose confederation of barbarous tribes, but it is said that the Zornakyan Dynasty of the Yeza tribe received a visitor from far away Luxterra bearing grim news - it was a Gorzaari priest that was fleeing from the recent conquests of the Zani Empire over his people.\n\nHe explained his goddess, the Goddess of Victory, watched over him and let him arrive in this blessed land, where he would meet a King and share with him divine symbols of strength. The incredulous King of the Yeza tribe would laugh at this tale, yet the priest insisted that his words were true and then challenged anyone to defeat him in a contest of poetry. It would be impossible for him to win, as he hardly could speak the native tongue, yet whenever stepped forward to challenge the priest, his opponent would choke on seemingly nothing and die.\n\nThe petty King of Yeza was taken aback at this supernatural display, and, deciding to test this goddess once more, commanded that the solar symbol of the Viktreic goddess be displayed upon the swords and shields of his soldiers. To his amazement, he managed to obtain victory after victory against forces two, three times greater than his own. He declared the goddess to be the patroness of the newly-founded kingdom."
 ATH_TREE: "$ATH$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nAlthough thousands of High Elven slave ships have sailed from Luxterra, the greatest adventurer of them all was Atheus, the legendary general that invaded the frozen island of Horteon. The High Elven invaders quickly destroyed all resistance to their rule before turning their attention to the prize of Arteon to their south, and although Atheus would fall in battle outside the walls of Saousvad'E a few years later, his legacy of destruction and enslavement remains an inspiration to those living within the Atheus Dominion."
 UPJ_TREE: "$UPJ$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nWhen the Great Collapse destroyed the Empire of the Ular-Pria, the Snakefolk living on the island of Kraklaz were the first to pull themselves out of the mire. From the citadel of Siznl, one of the only cities untouched by the calamity, the Uriyalok rapidly subdued all opposition to their authority and soon took the entire island for themselves."
 SE2_TREE: "$SE2$\n$HAS_BLOOD$\n\nEons ago, an expedition of Dori-sir Elves sailed far from their homelands in search of adventure and plunder, and after a perilous journey of forty days and nights, their armada was shipwrecked on the desolate Central Omniluxian Isles. Fearing that Death would soon claim them, the leader of these intrepid explorers, Alu-U Rethil-Ac, made a pact with Na'athran to save their lives; the Dori-sir would offer their Elven longevity to the gods if he would agree to make their small islands fertile. Na'athran heard their supplications and granted their request, causing eldritch forests to grow in the mountains of Anror Ta-Oswir. The descendants of Rethil-Ac continue to rule over their island from the citadel of Tuar-Antlada."
