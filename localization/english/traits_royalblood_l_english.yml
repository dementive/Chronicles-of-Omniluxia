Finding refuge in the city of Djeba, his ancestral home, the broken armies of the Baetep Empire managed to repel the invading forces sent to destroy them, and in the years to come, Khewer-Sedjet would unite four cities into a kingdom that he named Dune. It is the hope of his heirs that they will one day be able to defeat the foreigners that stole their Empire and reclaim the crown as the true Pharons of Baetep."

A failed statesman that was involved in a failed plot against the corrupt High Priests of the Skyreach Passes, Edis was banished by his kinsmen to live in the Deep Rift Valley and ordered to abandon his governorship. Instead of leaving peacefully, however, Edis spent a small fortune hiring soldiers, and after assembling an army of discontents and mercenaries to follow him, he launched a surprise attack against the native Goblins and Selaskusian tribes living on the Skyreach Steppes, forcing them back from their homelands at the foot of the mountains. His descendants rule as the Kings of Bad-Furqorin, the preeminent city of the region."
 cyrogelos: "Blood of Cyrogelos"
 cyrogelos_desc: "Cyrogelos was the right hand of Zanis the Great, and there is no question that the Emperor would have failed without the legendary general by his side. Rising through the ranks of the Imperial Army, Cyrogelos would introduce a series of reforms that would ensure the success of the Zani soldiers on the battlefield. Once these initiatives on land were completed, Cyrogelos would spend the next twenty years sailing the seas, winning hundreds of engagements for the Zanis Navy. At the end of a long, storied life that is filled with countless tales of heroic feats - Cyrogelos personally saved the life of Zanis more than once - the brave sailor was gifted a crown by Zanis and would rule as King of the Ytali. He remains the archetype of the faithful soldier."

 blood_of_euralyean_desc: "When the Great Collapse destroyed the Empire of the Ular-Pria, the Snakefolk living on the island of Kraklaz were the first to pull themselves out of the mire. From the citadel of Siznl, one of the only cities untouched by the calamity, the Uriyalok rapidly subdued all opposition to their authority and soon took the entire island for themselves."

 blood_of_nazani: "Blood of the Nazani"
 blood_of_nazani_desc: "The Imperials of the West consider themselves to be Nazani first and foremost, even though many of their Royal Houses were founded by cadet branches of the Zani Dynasty. Ever since the Zani Empire split in 690 LC, the history of the Nazani has been shaped and formed by the tumultuous events happening on Morrigon, not Luxterra, and the people have forgotten many of the cultural connections that they once shared with their eastern cousins. The 'Western Zani' do not celebrate the distant accomplishments of a long-forgotten conqueror from a foreign land, but choose to honor the Nazani Emperors that have ruled them for some three hundred years."

 blood_of_prophet: "Blood of the Zakara"
 blood_of_prophet_desc: "Descendants of the great Daro Zakara, first Kalif of the Zakara Kephal, the Zakara are one of the oldest families in Luxterra, with some claiming that they descend from the ancient Kings of the pre-Zainudian Zaraken Empire. However, with much of their bloodline slaughtered in the aftermath of the Great Zinduidian Revolt, the royals of this lineage now concern themselves with ensuring the continuation of their bloodline."

 blood_of_soventeir: "Blood of Uttarasmake the Great"
 blood_of_soventeir_desc: "The blood of Uttarasmake the Great, the first Soventeir Emperor and destroyer of the Yarenamian tribes, flows in the veins of this person, marking them as a member of one of the most elite Dragkhanic families and granting to them mystical powers. Uttarasmake was a mighty warrior and visionary that reformed the political structures of the Dragkhans, and his radical transformation of their tribal culture is what allowed the Soventeir Empire to be established. After his reign, no longer would his people be considered mere raiders and savage nuisances - a first in their history."

 blood_of_jarenam: "Blood of the Totrazi"
 blood_of_jarenam_desc: "The Totrazi clan, through guile and intrigue, managed to come out as the rulers of what was left of Jarenam the Formidable's empire.

 blood_of_myahudya: "Blood of the Victory Goddess"
 blood_of_myahudya_desc: "The Victory Goddess has blessed the ancestors of this individual with powers beyond mortal comprehension as a sign of the promised victory to come.

 blood_of_girm: "Blood of the Zalthu"
 blood_of_girm_desc: "Sons of the great warlord Girm Zalthu, the Zalthu clan are the traditional rulers of Droishuilco, the greatest of the Droishu settlements. Using his tactical mind and reforming the dysfunctional clan-based systems his people traditionally relied on, Lord Girm was able to march his men across the Dragon's Pass, finally uniting the disparate Hobgoblin tribes for the first time in centuries. Those who inherit his bloodline are keen to meet and even surpass his achievements."

 sanguine_blood: "Sanguine Blood"
 sanguine_blood_desc: "To mischaracterize and reduce the divine capabilities of the Sanguine Blood to being a 'Drow bloodline' reveals a fundamental misunderstanding about its nature; this is no mere trait to be passed on from father to son, mother to daughter, but a gift from the Eternal Darkness that has manifested itself into being. Those marked with the Sanguine Blood are chosen by the Blood-Stained gods and destined to become the nobility of the Sanguine Confederacy."

 atheus: "Blood of Atheus the Conqueror"
 atheus_desc: "Although thousands of High Elven slave ships have sailed from Luxterra, the greatest adventurer of them all was Atheus, the legendary general that invaded the frozen island of Horteon. The High Elven invaders quickly destroyed all resistance to their rule before turning their attention to the prize of Arteon to their south, and although Atheus would fall in battle outside the walls of Saousvad'E a few years later, his legacy of destruction and enslavement remains an inspiration to those living within the Atheus Dominion."

 blood_of_duny: "Blood of the Duny"
 blood_of_duny_desc: "Although the rebellion against the Zani Empire led by the Selaskusian tribes was doomed to failure, the proud horselords of the mountains were able to momentarily take their country back from their hated enslavers in a moment of glory. This ancient victory against overwhelming odds has become one of the defining myths of the Duny culture, and the descendants of the noble warriors that sacrificed their lives for the cause of freedom are still revered within their lands."

 bretagne: "Blood of the Jodok"
 bretagne_desc: "The Jodok Kings have long fought off the encroachments of the Aralans - and despite their Zanic ancestry, there is no doubt that they are the only bulwark against Aralans domination. Both powers have struggled against each other for control over Rohenoa and Rohevia, while the native Rohenoans are often either helpless victims or forced to pick a side. Expert horsemen whose knights dominate the plains, the knights of the Jodok clan are unequalled when fighting on open ground."

 blood_of_aralans: "Blood of the Merovingi"
 blood_of_aralans_desc: "The traditional Kings of the Aralans come from the Merovingi family, whose clan exercised their control over the Aralans from their seat of power at Racgerrac. As a foreign people to the Rohenevian Peninsula, the Aralans mercenaries remaining in the region were forced to unite under them once the Zani abandoned them. However this trial by fire worked in their favor, as the warrior-kings of the Merovingi forged a Kingdom only rivaled by the Bretagne of the north."

 blood_of_vetalian: "Blood of Vetalians"
 blood_of_vetalian_desc: "There were not many countries that were able to resist the armies of the Zani Empire or her colonists - ancient Empires were ground into dust and Kingdoms were shattered forever in the wake of the Great Conqueror - but the Vetalians of Morrigon were able to keep their independence at a time when others became slaves. The descendants of those proud tribesmen that kept out the strongest legions in Omniluxia are said to be brash, hot-headed warriors that love nothing more than seeking death on the battlefield."

 blood_of_ranazu: "Blood of Ranazu"
 blood_of_ranazu_desc: "The Ranazu goblins have managed to defeat not only their neighboring tribes to achieve power, but have also managed to destroy both Dwarven and Elven armies sent to dislodge them from their caverns and caves deep within the Skyreach Passages - no mean feat. Masters of launching surprise attacks, the armies of Nalafu raid throughout the Passages and the Foothills with impunity, enslaving any foolish enough to live close to their borders."

 blood_of_rendun: "Blood of Rendun"
 blood_of_rendun_desc: "For the first time in recorded history, an Orcish tribe has defeated and destroyed all challengers to their authority and have united the island of Rendun under its banner. Rendun has long been a place of chaos and warfare, for no one was ever able to establish a hegemony, and yet the members of this bloodline descend from those that conquered where no others had conquered before."

 blood_of_zewggad: "Blood of the Zewggad Senators"
 blood_of_zewggad_desc: "How does a small island manage to maintain not only its independence when surrounded by some of the largest Empires in Omniluxian history, but also has a thriving and vivacious democracy that has sometimes plunged the tiny island into civil war? With the natural gifts of diplomacy and political know-how that the original founders of the Zewggad Republic were blessed with, a trait that is common today in some of the Senators and Citizens of that fair isle."

 blood_of_eldritch: "Blood of the Eldritch Forest"
 blood_of_eldritch_desc: "Those Wood Elves that are blessed with the Blood of the Eldritch Forest can claim that they are descended from the Mother Goddess herself, and that they share the same soul and destiny as the World's Lungs Forest and Omniluxia itself. Hailing from the most ancient caretakers of the First Trees, the bearers of this bloodline have a special connection to nature and animals and are natural Druids."

 blood_of_sea_elves: "Blood of Alu-U Rethil-Ac"
 blood_of_sea_elves_desc: "Eons ago, an expedition of Dori-sir Elves sailed far from their homelands in search of adventure and plunder, and after a perilous journey of forty days and nights, their armada was shipwrecked on the desolate Central Omniluxian Isles. Fearing that Death would soon claim them, the leader of these intrepid explorers, Alu-U Rethil-Ac, made a pact with Na'athran to save their lives; the Dori-sir would offer their Elven longevity to the gods if he would agree to make their small islands fertile. Na'athran heard their supplications and granted their request, causing eldritch forests to grow in the mountains of Anror Ta-Oswir. The descendants of Rethil-Ac continue to rule over their island from the citadel of Tuar-Antlada."

 blood_of_eastern_star: "Blood of the Eastern Star"
 blood_of_eastern_star_desc: "When the Star from the East fell into Northstar Bay in ancient times, there were those living amongst the Mikkosrie tribes that were unafraid of the Strangers that emerged from the water and welcomed them to their settlements. The Visitors would teach the tribesmen the ways of civilization and religion, and the Stellaric Faithful remember these priceless gifts bestowed upon their ancestors to this day. Those that carry the Blood of the Eastern Star are blessed with a divine blood that can be traced to these mysterious Strangers that came to Omniluxia many years ago."
