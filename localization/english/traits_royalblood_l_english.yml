 blood_of_nazani_desc: "The Imperials of the West consider themselves to be Nazani first and foremost, even though many of their Royal Houses were founded by cadet branches of the Zanis Dynasty. Ever since the Zani Empire split in 690 LC, the history of the Nazani has been shaped and formed by the tumultuous events happening throughout Morrigon, not Luxterra, and our people have forgotten many of the connections that they shared with their eastern cousins. The 'Western Zani' do not celebrate the distant accomplishments of a long-forgotten conqueror from a foreign land, but choose to honor the Nazani Emperors that have ruled them for some three hundreds years."

 blood_of_vetalian: "Blood of Vetalians"
 blood_of_vetalian_desc: "There were not many countries that were able to resist the armies of the Zani Empire or her colonists - ancient Empires were ground into dust and Kingdoms were shattered forever in the wake of the Great Conqueror - but the Vetalians of Morrigon were able to keep their independence at a time when others became slaves.

Fearing that Death would soon claim them, the leader of these intrepid explorers, Alu-U Rethil-Ac, made a pact with Na'athran to save their lives; the Dori-sir would offer their Elven longevity to the gods if he would agree to make the desert islands fertile. Na'athran heard their supplications and granted their request, turning the Sea Elves skin blue as a sign that they were marked as holy. The descendants of Rethil-Ac continue to rule over their island from the eldritch forests of Tuar-Antlada."
