 startup_events.1.t:0 "The Zarakens Rise To Lead"
 startup_events.1.desc:0 "As Zartosht II took the throne of the Zakaran nomadic confederacy and rightfully claimed the title of Khan, he sensed the Golden Dwarves of Yamhad weakness after the Dunydurceg steppe hordes & The Zainuddians Karkšm had weakened them.\n In 980 L.C he invaded the Bronze foot hills, reaching as far as the Eastern Karkšm provinces. The greatest victory was against the Yamhad King, who was killed in battle. Just when all looked lost,The Yamhad allies in Western Karkšm intervened and pushed the Zakaran nomads forces back to Kashan, reclaiming the lost eastern provinces for themselves.\n After Zartosht's death to illness, his son Ctesiphon took the throneof a now settled and reformed tribe, vowing to continue the fight against Yamhad and bring unimaginable greatness to the House of Zakara."

 startup_events.2.t:0 "Birth of the purple Phoenix"
 startup_events.2.desc:0 "At its greatest extent the Zani Empire stretched from luxterreich to the coasts of the Morrigon & Western Karkšm. However, now it is divided, the East and West Zani Empires are mere shadows of their former-selves, Omniluxia is splitting apart, usurpers and would-be invaders threaten to tear them apart from all sides.\nThe Zani's ambition however should never be underestimated. It is the very same ambition that led to Wegallia's birth and rise to domination. It is now the only thing standing between it and annihilation.\nThe setting-up of a new administrative center at Wegallia has allowed the Nazanis to replace the antiquated systems throttling the economy and enfeebling their Emperors. As a result, new trade networks and fiscal reforms fill its coffers, while the Senate is powerless, replaced by a centralized bureaucracy forming a powerful state. The West is now Zani’s true seat of power."
