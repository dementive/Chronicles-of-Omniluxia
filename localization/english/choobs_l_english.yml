 #Monarchy Serfdom Laws
 monarchy_land_law:0 "Serfdom Laws"
 serfdom_encourage:0 "Manors Encouraged"    
 serfdom_encourage_desc:0 "The fractured post Great Collapse world has seen the rise of Manors across lands not unified by the remaining great empires. This system consists of local landowning nobles ruling over the peasants who work the land, protecting the land from bandits and invading armies while also providing taxes for the royal court."
 institutionalized_serfdom:0 "Institutionalized Serfdom"    
 institutionalized_serfdom_desc:0 "While the great empires remain dependent on large slave estates, various smaller kingdoms including those of the Silver Dwarves have made serfdom an institution important to the function of their state. Providing taxes to the King and local nobility as well as protection for the local peasantry, this system has become the backbone of many local economies."
 noble_rights_respected:0 "Noble Rights Respected"    
 noble_rights_respected_desc:0 "While serfdom in much of the realm is largely obsolete in the face of large slave estates or productive free holds, the crown has pragmatically protected the various landed elites' claims to their hereditary estates, which include the serfs working the land."
 free_holds:0 "Free Holds"    
 free_holds_desc:0 "Radical in every sense of the word, 'Free Holds' are lands owned and worked by the local peasantry. Found amongst certain frontier communities in Polaria, this system doesn't provide the protections of Manorialism, but is more productive."

 #Republic Serfdom Laws
 republican_land_law:0 "Serfdom Laws"
 noble_domination:0 "Noble Domination"    
 noble_domination_desc:0 "While most republics are home to multiple families of landed elites, few have promoted their influence to the level of absolute domination. While production and wealth would soar for the nobility, few outside of those few families would see their level of prosperity."
 serfdom_backbone:0 "Noble Rights Respected"    
 serfdom_backbone_desc:0 "Due to the extensive influence of the nobility in our republic, it is important to recognize the claims of the landed elites to keep them placated."
 freemen_empowered:0 "Freemen Empowered"    
 freemen_empowered_desc:0 "To upset the preeminence of the nobility in our government, talks of radical legislation have circulated seeking to uplift the power of the citizenry and the freemen. By granting freemen more important political offices and lands, the old landed elites would slowly see their power whittle away."

 #Monarchy Slavery Laws

 monarchy_slave_society:0 "Institutionalized Slavery"
 monarchy_slave_society_desc:0 "Large slave estates are the backbone of the Razani Empire, High Elven Empires, and the Ular-Pria. As such, slavery is such an important institution that slaves have become an essential part of their economies and bureacracies."
 monarchy_slavery_abolished:0 "Prohibited Slavery"
 monarchy_slavery_abolished_desc:0 "For many post Great Collapse societies, slavery has become obsolete, replaced largely by serfdom. However, there are those who see themselves morally above enslaving other conscious beings."

 #Republic Slavery Laws
 republican_slavery_law:0 "Slavery Laws"
 republican_slavery_present:0 "Slavery Unregulated"
 republican_slavery_present_desc:0 "Slavery in our society is neither promoted nor obsolete, and those wealthy enough to afford to purchase large slave estates do so without penalties."

 republican_slave_society_desc:0 "Large slave estates are the backbone of the Razani Empire, High Elven Empires, and the Ular-Pria. As such, slavery is such an important institution that slaves have become an essential part of their economies and bureacracies."
 republican_slave_trade:0 "Slave Trade Embraced"
 republican_slave_trade_desc:0 "While some states benefit from the large slave estates that make up the backbone of their economy, our merchant republic has taken advantage of this demand. By supplying the demands of these large estates, we can take a portion of the profits of this system for ourselves."
 republican_slavery_abolished:0 "Prohibited Slavery"
