 omen_neiya:0 "Neiya"
 omen_neiya_desc:0 "A goddess of death, Neiya is said to have been created around the same time as the #G Zerywan#! were, but by different origin. Neiya was created directly by #G Wielkopan#! and thus had much more prominence in the past.

 omen_rossovi_desc:0 "The #Y Brother of the South#!, Rossovi is the wild brother of the three.

He did not contact the other two brothers after his migration, yet even with this isolation, the people of Rossovie were successful and the worship of Rossovi persists to this day."

Said to have been blessed by the #G Zerywan#! themselves, Zehi was given the lands north of #T Jelen Mountain#!. Zehi's folly was that of peace. He believed in harmony and distilled this amongst his people, but they could not help him against the western invaders. He did, however, get help from #G Lechi#! to retain the remaining parts of his people's lands. It is said that the Zehian people are destined to reclaim what was lost in the west."

 omen_jelenia:0 "Jelenia"
 omen_jelenia_desc:0 "The Great Celestial Deer, revered most by the Western Zerywani. The origins of the deity are shrouded in mystery.

 omen_zerywan:0 "Zerywan"
 omen_zerywan_desc:0 "The most important deity of the Zerywani people, the Zerywan are the twin deities, brothers that come from the womb of the primordial goddess of earth herself. Zerywan's reverence superceded that of other local deities because unlike the #Y Four Great Gods#! of Omniluxia or the #Y Primordial Gods#!, Zerywan would personally live amongst people for a time. Eventually, Zerywan would bless individual people or societies who revered them most, however, after the incident of the #Y Three Brothers#!, Zerywan took a more reserved and less direct role in mortal affairs. Still, his impact is said to be felt strongly throughout the peninsula."
