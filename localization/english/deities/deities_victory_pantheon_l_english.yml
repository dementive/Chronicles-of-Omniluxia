omen_viza:0 "Viza"
omen_viza_desc:0 "When the #E Zornakyan dynasty#! adopted the #E Viktreic#! faith, their interpretation of the #G Victory Goddess#! changed to reflect their society. Causing a religious schism as well as already dealing with #R High Elven#! invaders, the #E Viktriec#! faithful of #E Arteon#! worshipped a goddess who they believed would grant them salvation and victory in battle only if they conquered others in her name.\n\n It is forbidden by #E Myahudyan#! law to create art in her image, so she is often depicted by the #T Zornakyan star#! with the #T Eye of Victory#! in the middle, overseeing the victory of her chosen people."

omen_mataxa:0 "Mataxa"
