Staying faithful despite this, Ye-Liang reflected the light of Ri-Szing so that he may still have some connection despite his lowly existence, however, the cost of this means that Ye-Liang must die and reincarnate twice per month. In some lives, she is able to even see Ri-Szing and enjoy a brief moment of embrace. It is said that this 'eclipse' results in the birth of a new god. In occasions where Ye-Liang turns red, she is said to have fought recently with Ri-Szing."

While having much more brightness, Ri-Szing is lonely, and no other star shines when Ri-Szing is out. The legend states that once Ri-Szing and Szing-Szing were having a dispute. Ri-Szing chose power, stating that with all the power, the people would love him most. Szing-Szing chose trust, saying that the people would love him the most if they trusted in him.

omen_wodi_desc:0 "Wo-Di is the patron of scholars. He was said to have arrived in person on the first wave of immigration, teaching the local Adhmhuchi the ways of the stars with his flawless translations.

omen_kolofal:0 "Kolofal Sziao-Gung"
omen_kolofal_desc:0 "Kolofal would take on the name Sziao-Gung upon his death, becoming the very first local Adhmhuchi to become a star and reach divine equivalence. In life, Kolofal was known to be a street thief. One day, he stole from a Stellaric priest, and instead of turning him in, the priest told him that no matter what he steals he would not be able to improve his life. The young Kolofol continued his nefarious ways, but in his mind, this message never left him.\n\nMany years later, the guilt built up, and Kolofol would convert to Stellaric ways, to learn from the very priest who had let him continue his malificient ways all those years ago. His new place amongst the priesthood gave him purpose and happiness. He developped the miraculous ability to heal women suffering from severe childbirth pains, a gift from the stars it was said. While he did not 'deserve' his powers from the start, he earned his place amongst the stars. And like his story, his star shines dimly at first, and brightens deeper into the night."

omen_tarra:0 "Tarra"
omen_tarra_desc:0 "Tarra is the daughter of Renjuun and Rojuun, also called the Red Moon. She became more prominent after the arrival of the foreign Stellaric believers. Tarra represents a woman's cycle, appearing every month inconsistently. Sometimes she acts with very predictable nature, and other times she is missing for a month. Most people are not able to observe the phenomenon of the Red Moon, it is only visible if one is blessed by the stars or they have drank a Stellaric potion."

omen_zwizhu:0 "Zwizhu"
omen_zwizhu_desc:0 "Also called the Finality, Zwizhu is visible as one of the brightest stars of the sky. He is both the first and last star that is visible before the day star leaves and comes. When the last universe ended. Zwizhu was supposedly the only survivor. And when this universe ends, Zwizhu will once more be the sole survivor. While some interpret this idea as the idea of doom and others interpret this as a symbol of hope, the truth of the matter is that he is neither. He simply is, and that is a concept that humanity will never be able to reconcile.\n\nThe cult of Zwizhu is quite attractive to many people in the Stellaric community, so much so that his cult can even rival the cult of Szing-Szing. Some have even begun to say that he is the one true star and no other stars are true."

deity_szilia:0 "$omen_szilia$"
omen_szilia:0 "Szi-Lia"
omen_szilia_desc:0 "Szi-Lia is sometimes called the Blue moon. Unlike her equivalent, Tarra, who is from the local pantheon, Szi-Lia has unknown origins. Perhaps she is a mixture of Tarra and a Stellaric philosopher. Her name even seems foreign to both the foreign language and the native language. Regardless, the Blue moon represents the male phenomenon of sexual dreams upon reaching the age of manhood. Thus, she appears far more frequently than Tarra, yet also, far less intensely. She is said to be the direct reason for these sexual dreams, and is one of the reasons that despite the holy nature of Stellaric believers, they are allowed sexual freedom, for it is simply a part of the human nature and human experience."
