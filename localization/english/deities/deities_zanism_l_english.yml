 omen_first_emperor:1 "Zanis"
 omen_first_emperor_desc:4 "#E Zanis#! was an #Y Eageli-Zani#! general who invaded and conquered all of #T Luxterra#!. It is said he looked to the horizon and asked why it did not belong to him, before claiming that very horizon by the right of conquest. His name literally means 'the one of the people,' and thus, the #Y Geallian#! people regard #E Zanis#! as a demi-god who will protect them in times of need. Despite his #Y Eageli#! origin, the Empire became a unifying force for all #Y Geallian#! people. The new #Y Zanic#! people wish to once more capture the brilliance of #R Zanis#! the Great and his empire."
