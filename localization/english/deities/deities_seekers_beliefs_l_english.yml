omen_itdis:0 "Zastan Sidian"
omen_itdis_desc:0 "Sidian is the patron of the impovrished and needy, and thus his followers are conercned with espousing the virtues of charity, hope, and kindness to all who may listen. In life he was a man of supposed mixed heritage, born to the Lupinorax clan of Sedhuacor through the union of a Geallaiaus freedman and an indigenous noble woman. When he had come of age and left the confines of his family's nomadic lifestyle, he sought to make a name for himself among the scholars and orators of the Weaglian cities . There he would often call  for the cooperation between his differing kinfolk, fueled with the intent of catsting aside the chains of Imperium Razanus. Not only did he advocate for such virtues, he also wrote many treatises demanding for the emancipation of those enslaved wizards, claiming their souls were no different from the mundane citizenry. These moral inclinations of his would help lead to the famous mage revolt of Eresemia, in which the short lived magocratic kingdom of the same name had been temporarily revived under the leadership of the legendary Chaiasechui. Unfortunately, however, Sidian's many insitgations of societal uprising were discovered in the aftermath of Eresmia's downfall, and for his acts of dissent he, alongside other like-minded compatriots of his who too caused problems for Imperium Razanus, was rounded-up like cattle and executed for the public to jeer. Since then he has been kept in the hearts of those people who benefited from his ideals, slinking among the shadows both urban and wilder, only to finally make their exodus westwards where they then integrated both themselves and their idol amidst the Cerwainite folk."

omen_axnir_desc:0 "The school of Astonixia is beloved and well practiced by the Seeker denizens of the Dragon Valley, espousing ideas of liberty and resopect for all peoples. Despite this liberal flair inherent to her teachings, even those among those who reign within the upper echelons of society still keep Astonixia close in their hearts, for her name as surmounts all other saints due to her role as the founding mother of the Seeker peoples. A Celtican soothsayer born to the roving band of Thuothac, Astonixia became troubled when the Razanites made swell the mines and quarries along their borders with the misery of the magical folk of whom they had enslaved. The brazen druid strove forward against this injustice, enlisting her kinsmen in order to make free the countless souls who were squandering their potential in those horrid places. She taught them the secrets to her people's mysticism, combining them with the few occultic traditions that had survived among her Zanite followers. They then roamed across the countryside, striking blows against the colonial legions as they put to torch a hundred slave pens, freeing the denizens within. However, as Astonixia grew weary from years of conflict, she directed her followers to the Dragon Valley, claiming that such a place shall be their new home. There she lived out the rest of her life with her followers, becoming those ancestral vagabonds who went on to become the Seeker Orders."

omen_qizdite:0 "Zastan Chisitesa"
omen_qizdite_desc:0 "Concerned for the sanctity of all human life, whether arcane or otherwise, Chisitesa was a staunch advocate for the rights of those margianalized mystics within the Zani Empire. She wrote numerous treatises deconstructing the social differences between a magical and mundane person, claiming that the total sum of their personage were equal to one another. She preached for the practical uses of magic, bellowing loudly that societal matters such as fertility and agriculture were heavily reliant on the gatekept traditions of the clergy, and that those born with the innate power to wield magic absent of a god's presence were vital in keeping the nation strong. Unfortunately, Chisitesa was sentenced to death under the false accusations of sowing dissent despite her fierce love for the country that condemned her, with the Razanite governors going so far as to arrest her own family shortly after execution. Followers of her school are thus loathe to forget her sacrifice and beliefs, displaying strong convictions for their country and practices. The many people who worship her memory do so by taking upon themselves the profession of militant clerics, founding sub-orders loyal to their respective state that are willing to either march out in war as warriors and healers, or to simply lend their wisdom to their superior magisters."

omen_aldir_desc:0 "The lady of the learned folk, Amaltar was in life a wealthy and yet humble woman born to a household of mixed Ytalo-Zani origins. Having emigrated with her kin to the coastal colonies of Weaglia as a young girl, Amaltar grew up on the tales of hedge wizards and wild mages who safeguarded the ancient practices of the land. Fascinated by such things well into her adult life, she utilized her family's wealth to found a magician's haven sanctioned by the local magistrate, inspiring people from all across the Raanite colonies to follow suit and make their own cases for mage habitation. Unfortunately, while her actions were by all means legal, the common folk did not view it as such, and would routinely persecute Amaltar and her people as much as they could. Still, in face of the hatred thrown against her and the people she now welcomed as her own family, Amaltar remained persistent in her tendency for kindness, encouraging many of her followers to aid their mundane neighbors with the intent of fostering good relations. Sadly, this would all boil down into violence as Amaltar's familial home was burnt to the ground with her, her kinsmen, and magical wards all inside it. Hatred thus stirs among followers of her school, for they are quick to show compassion and understanding towards their fellow Seekers, yet possess nothing but scorn towards the Zanites."

When the conflict came to a cose, he fell madly in love with a Ytalian wizardess by the name of Chiora, wedding the moment she agreed to their union. They then sired into the world twins, one made of the same magical properties that flowed within their mother, and the other having been born with the mundane essence of their father. Yet tragedy would befall their family, as Chiora was then struck dead in the marketplace, killed by a local inquistor despite her status as a sanctioned mage. Consumed by fury, Chistospis slew the man who had been responsible for his wife's murder. Afterwards he and his children fled for the continent of Weaglia, settling in what was the Razani colonial magistrate. Even here, did Chistospis not relent in the vengeance that drove him to bloodshed, hunting those who had dared persecute people like his departed love, making himself a hushed legend among the people and a bane towards the authorities. His story ended tragically, however, for one of his sons, Chiorupino the mundane one, slew his own brother and then outsed his father to the Inquisitor Order. The story of this betreyal is thus forever marred into the minds of Chistospis' followers, urging them to seek out vengeance against who would harm their fellow magicians."

He could see the spirits of the dead that lingered in the air, he saw the essence of one's soul that made animate the flesh, and most importantly he understood the meaning of all material objects as were placed by the gods, and was thus able to configure these things to work to his benefit. Deprived of any great figure of magical intuition, Naearisios' gift was left unnoticed by those around him as he learned to master the powers that were inherent to his being. With his skills made manifest, he took upon himself the life of an architect in order to better the quaint townage of Chanonaes. In time, he was accused by the priests of his village for being a magician in disguise, and was thus sentenced to the local arena to live and die as fodder for the captive beasts that were resigned there. Despite his murder, all because he desired to do good by his people, the followrs of Naearisios are compassionate folk who are always looking for ways to improve the lives of their fellow men, even if their work does not pertain to any sort of benifit towards themselves.."

omen_nova_desc:0 "Said to have wandered the colonial frontiers of Razanite Weaglia, the saintly Nova was a mystical healer who aided the peoples both native and settler, preaching her good word of kindness and good will to all. Those followers of her school claim that she was in fact the vessel by which a mighty spirit sought to help steer the world away from the direction it was headed. Abhorred by the rising sentiment that derided magiciains, the spirit and its ward taught the peoole once more the goodness of magic and all that it had to offer. The pair is most famous for having helped soothe the spirits of Tenepara, who began growing uneasy by the encorach of mortals, creating assign unions between the two parties as to ensure the peace. The colonial magistrate an their inquisitor subordinates, however, did not view them in the same light as the many people whom they had aided. With violent cruelty, the Zanites chased Nova all across the colonies, eventually slaying her with clerical magic that churned her insides out and transformed her blood into urine. As for her spirit companion, they trapped the it deep within an old cistern, of which the disciples of this school search for relentlessly both day and night."

Among those made in bondage were those people who had been ostracised for displaying some level of magical latency that was neither too insignificant to be ignored, nor too dangerous to call upon the inquisitors of the Razani Empire. Ziarae, affronted by this debase cruelty inflicted upon his fellow mages, would dedicate many nights in order to lead away those captives from his familial estate. Passage upon privateers did her afford for his fellows, forging for them fake credential with the intent of helping start for themselves a new life within Weaglia. When his father had discovered his acts, it is said that he slew his own son in a fit of rage, only to become overwhelemed by a wave of grief so sensational that he too took his own life in the process. The followers of this school have learnt to follow through on Ziarae's action, holding true to their allegiance to mage kind over one's own direct kindred."

omen_ogzotz_desc:0 "Distinct in that he is one of the few inhuman saints who make up a quarter of the Seeker schools, Oskot was a half-orc by birth, sired by a Morrigian woman to the chief of the Largaduru. It was during his youth did a terrible plague sweep through the lands of Mowhrighen, taking from the earth thousands of mortal lives. Among the casualties were Oskot's own parents, driving him into a long period of grief in which he had become laden with visions of the dead. From among the hosts of spirits who sought refuge within his mind, there came the voices of his ancestors both orc and man. They proclaimed that this plague was a punishment from the gods, upset that the peoples of the west abandoned their magical traditions in favor of garnering good faith with an empire that sought their subjagation. Filled with fury, Ogzotz rallied the people of the Borderlands, marching them across the Wall of God. He spent years campaiging along the eastern coasts, terrorizing the disorganized Weaglians. In time, he returned west after his rage subsided, migrating his horde all the way to Dragon Valley, where his orc followers became mixed with the native humans, their descendents becoming the Dumnonians. A relatively recent addition, the glory of Oskot was brought under the Seeker fold during the intermingling period between the Orcano-Celts and their Zano-Vetali neighbors, and he has since attracted numerous followers who share with him a warlike spirit."

Yet, the presence of both can be felt all across wherever the Seeker faith can be found, as if they were spirits hanging in the air, or a voice nestled deep in the earth, ready to help guide the mages of Weaglia in all places they reside. With motives unknown, folklore abounds of a fae enchanteress who stole the children of Zanites and raised them in the ways of magic, teaching them how to control the green around them. Wherever one wanders into the woods of western Weaglia at night, to hear the voices of singing children allows one to know where they have managed to intrude upon. If you be a person of mundane properties, it would be advisable for you to leave immediately. Yet, for those men and women who have magic flowing through their veins, the children of the woods would be more than accepting of you and the potential you bring."

These items were often the loot stolen by the Zanite legions during their conquests of Mowhrighen and beyond, items which Walthos was more than glad to return to his estranged kinsfolk who continued to vie against the colonial powers. His trade was not only restricted to goods and baubles, but as well in people, for he would buy from the cruel slavers of Weaglia their cringing stock, taking with him at least a coupe hundred of slaves, of whom he had brought to the tribes of Mowhrighen and were thus welcomed by their new tribal community. Unlike many of the Seeker saints, however, his good deeds were not rewarded with a tragic death, and was instead allowed to die in peace surrounded by the companions he made along his journey. Walthos' followrers are composed most often by the merchant folk of Seeker society, who always strive to follow his example in retrieving magical artifacts to be cherished and well guarded."

Using her jurisprudence as a holy woman, she helped sanction numerous magical beings from the prying influence of the inquisitors, saving countless lives from their devase cruelty. Her noble efforts, however, led to her being targeted by her fellow clergy folk, who were upset that she sought to diminish their authority in the realm of magic. They accused her of worshipping demons, condemmed her for cavorting with wild mages, and sentenced her to be shipped towards the colonies of Weaglia as slave labor. Yet still, even though she was chained below the rotting deck of a privateer ship, Obium insitgated an uprising among her fellow serviles, leading them to take command of the vessel. As if saved by divine providence, the boat led them to the marshland shores of Mowrighen, where the Zanite freemen became mxed with the local marshlanders, becoming the Sadasizi. The school Obium is thus fairly attractive to Morrigians and former slaves, of which those folk often preach to others the virtures of bravery and fortitude."

Sired to the illustrious house of Paritoas as auspicious moonlight shone down upon his home, he was blessed by the gods themselves with magic. Though normally, such children are neutralized by the inquisitors, the wealth and influence of the Paritoas kept them away from their beloved child. As such, Parimades was given the proper supervision to regulate the power flowing within him, granted protection by the emperor of the time himself. Parimades was thus enlisted in the imperial army, and was soon transferred to help supress uprisings in the western frontiers. It was here Parimades became disgusted with the treatment as was inflicted upon his fellow magic users, questioning his own ideas of what it meant to be a mage under Zanite authority. When the poortunity first presented itself, Parimades deserted his regiment and fled into the woodland dark, rubbing elbows with the Mowhrighen mystics as they did battle with the inquisitors who hunted them. He thus a becme a wandering legend among the peoples of the old west, derided by his mundane counterparts, yet an inspiration to those followers of his school."

The last born son of Chief Eaberand, Eachrianoc was the least liekly to inherit any land upon his father's death, and was thus not requested to accompany his brothers during their time as hostages of the Zanite colonial magistrate. It was only after the death of his father did both of his siblings return, yet they would not be unapposed. Despite being only thirteen at the time, Eachrianoc possessed of rage like a raven and the stubborness of a boar, Eachrianoc bellowed that his brothers were unfit of their father's chiefdom, claiming that they had become submissive to the reign of the Zanites. His people, composed of similar sentiments, chased away their would-be leaders, and instead swore themselves to young firebrand. With staunch bravery, Eahrianoc chose to allign his people with the likes of Axnir the soothsayer to the north, eventually following her into the Dragon Valley after their successive campaigns together.

While a bandit through and through, he was righteous in who he pillaged and who he protected, lending his aid to the downtrodden and weak whilst making sure imperial institutions such as the inquisitors were most often the victims of his daring raids. With a warband composed primarily of Celticans and Silver Dwarves, Asazantur is reminisched fondly even in the myths and stories of these two peoples for his crusade against the foreign power that had come into the west. A man known for both his golden tongue and golden heart, he was once able to swindle a land owner out of nearly all of his wealth and nothing more than words alone, giving away all such goods to the people  without fears of reprisal from the then destitute baron, his minions having thus left his barren state for the company of Aszantur. His followers are thus often jesters, merchants, and eccentrics, whose words are just as tricky in the ways of oratory."

Able to make bend the oaks and green, Palpaduav bent the woodlands to his will in order to provide safe passage for his magician allies, able to create pathways that confounded the likes of the imperial inquisitors, and yet gave way for those seeking to curb their influence. It is said that most Seeker alchemical traditions can trace their origins back to Palpaduav, who taught the fleeing Zanite mages which herbs and fruits were edible, and which ones were not, helping prevent death and sickness whenever he could for the already diminished mage populations who roamed the woodlands of Weaglia. The followers of Palpaduav is composed almost entirely of doctors and alchemists, who always look to further expand both their own personal knowledge, and as well as socital knowledge through preaching their lores."

Born in a time when the provinces of Weaglia were just still recovering from the dreaded Orc Years, the young girl was exposed to all sorts of political discourse within the confines of her own home. Many landowners were dismayed when the imperial legions failed to muster any resistance against the pillaging barbarians, and thus chose to try and break away from the colonial magistrate in an attempt to establish their own fiefdoms. Atachupia's father was one such man, counted among the list of failed warlords during the Interregnum. Forced to retreat within his last citadel, a siege thus ensued that lasted for over three months before Atachupia came into agreement with the besiegers, asking for safe passage for the local women and all that their oxen may carry. With this agreement made, the castle's women hurled upon the backs of their steeds the bods of their battered husbands and fathers, their brothers and uncles, hidden under the ancient tapestries of Supoluan. They were thus able to escape northwards into the lands of the Fidiaio, thus becoming the Fideli people. The Seeker school of Atachupia is thus often attended by diplomats, politicians, and orators who pray to her spirit, asking for the same suave thinking that compelled her that day"

Deemed the greatest trickster of his era, on par with the mythical rogues of Mowrighen's many ancient folktales. It is said that he could make water dry by singing, giving it a despicable texture that could sap the moisture out of anything, and that air would turn solid if he so wished for it, making the lungs of his foes become burdened with a terrible pain. Regardless, the many people who surrounded themselves with his company claimed that he was possessed of a delightful aura, able to make smile even the most downtrodden of people. Many myths abound claiming that he was the avatar of some forgotten god who had become displeased with the arrival of the Zanites. Yet, despite such intriguing tales, Balbatoc was made famous most especially for his power to confound the natural laws of mankind and turn the fleshen cadavers of men into a cleansed and consumable product. He taught this bale technique to the many desperate mages who fled from the Zanite colonies, his teachings eventually culminating into the many schools of blood magic that circulate withint Seeker society. These followers of Balbatoc, while often shunned by most people, have gained for themselves clerical recognition from the reigning Seeker states, and have grown in number over the ages."

Though a magister by profession, Panichuros rarely adhered himself to the anti-mage laws that permeated the careers of his fellow governors, and so sent word across the frontiers that his lands were safe for any mage who sought refuge. As such, his once meager province of Eresemia became a hotspot of magical innovation and lifestyle, being dubbed as 'Wizard's Country' by the surrounding territories. Many of his rivals claimed that he was in fact seeking to produce his own personal mage army, aiming to overthrow the colonial government. But such accusations simply fell on deaf ears, as neighboring governors did not seem to care where the magicians went, only that they travel far away from their own holdings. In time, Eresem became largely independent not by means of insurrection, but rather due to sheer neglect on part of the Zani Empire's aversion to mages. This allowed for the shortly lived state of Eresemia, a nation in all but name. He is remembered fondly by the likes of the magister-kings of Dragon Valley, who pray to him that their state shall forever prosper."

He was distinct in his position in that he genuinely strove to uphold the values of his equestrian ancestors, striving to be annointed knighthood just as his forebears were. He was thus dispatched as another levied commander in sevice of the emperor, sent to annihilate the unruly tribes of the Rohenoans. Whereas his companions showed derision for the so called 'backwards folk' of the west, Oruhallus was saintly in that he chose to spare those innocent lives of the violence that lept from the souls of his warriors. He dedicated many nights arguing with his superiors, demanding that they should treat the conquered peoples with kindness. He claimed that the best way to subdue them was to win over their genuine loyalty, going so far as to volunteer himself to serve as their magistral representative. Though many decried him with fierce oppositition, suspecting that they he had sought the title in order to lead his own rebellion, the emperor himself relented. Oruhallus thus laid the first kindlings that led to the genesis of the many syncretic peoples of the western continent, and is thus viewed as a founding father among such cultures."

Her father, Imperator Tosovochio, refused to yield either his consort and child to the cruelties of the clergy, and so created a new law, one which allowed all emperors, current and proceeding, to grant sanctions upon certain magical individuals if they so choose to. Though faced with much public backlash, enough so as to warrant a civil war that nearly brought the empire to its knees, Imperator Tosovochio stood firm in his decision in order to keep his beloved Sadinupa safe. The girl in question, however, did not remain idle in her time within the imperial palace. With guile that many suspect to have been magical in nature, she used her words alone to make parley with the relatives of rebels who had stayed in the capital city of Durobaeraste. She used them to help convince many of the rebel factions to stand down and submit to the emperor, turning the tide of war for the better.

In the few myths that survived him, it is believed that he was compelled by a higher power in order to prepare the people of Weaglia for the day of salvation. He preached that the Zani Empire was bound to die, that one day another great catastrophe would befall it as the Great Collapse of Omniluxia had struck once prior. Yet, despite his apocalytpic foretellings, Garapagos was a kind and hunmble man, who is said to have worked alongside the many freefolk who filled the colonies, performing miracles and healing the sick. Yet his teachings could not be left unbothered in the eyes of the Zanite inquisitors, who publicly tortured him, demanding that he retract what they believed to be false words.

Still, she was a lawyer who as well served the comman man, and was thus lauded by even the mundane folk who would have otherwise been disgusted by her actions as a savior of mages, and thus evaded death on a number of occasions due to her support from the people, able to live well into her old age as she died peacefully.

In secret, however, there was one subject of which he was forbidden to teach, and yet was compelled to do so regrdless. In hiding he taught to those sanctioned mages the secrets to his clerical magic, allowing them to make use of their once unused potential. Erandas was eventually discovered one faithful morning, his auditorium then stormed by a members onf Inquisitor Order. He claimed that he was simply upholding the truth of his god, of all gods, that all peoples had the right to learn. This, of coure, fell on deaf ears within the imperial courtroom, and Erandas was susbequently executed the next morning.

When the farmlands that provided for the city people had been burnt, there came a time of great famine, leading to a period of intense banditry as the people grew ever more desperate in those struggling times, with some going so far as to allign themselves with the greenskin menance that brought ruin to their homes. Tasked with shielding those innocents of the time, Pichosinma was one of the many defenders of Temundos castle, the last line of defense for those territories down south of it. Thus, when an Orcanite sub-captain led a daring raid against the fortress, one in which the local commander had been slain by a traitorous contingent of Zanites, it is said that Pichosinma took command of his then panicking subordinates, thus executing those who had dared betrayed their oath to defend the people. Though this would not stop the besiegers from breaching the walls, under Pichosinma's leadership they routed the invaders, taking the heads of a hundred orcs in the process.

The leader of a volunteer militia comrpised of primarily non-Zanites, Anichures was made famous for defense of his home when a pack of mighty gryphons descended upon his homestead village. Five monsters were his count on that day, the pelts he skinned from them thus adorning his armor to signify his status as a slayer of aberrant beasts. With his warhammer made ascendent in the realm of myth, Anichures became brazen in his quest to hunt down the creatures of the Wall of God, taking with him all who were eager to claim glory as he did. In their quest to their mountainous hunting grounds, Anichures made tidings with a tribe of Morrigians who, after becoming awe stricken by the gryphons pelts that bedecked his stature, joined him on his epic quest to slay monsters to the western mountains. Through caverns they ventured, in the old dwarven tunnels did they find devils that were laid there. The many tendrilled cadavers, the scuttling ones with slimy ichor, and the feral ghouls who stalked the underground with wolf-like prowess, all these and more were made eradicated by this band of adventurers. After a year of hunting, Anichures led his people back to Piron, settling the tribal folk who accompanied him, laying the foundations for soon to be city Pironuia. Those followers of his school are made up most often by the hunters of Seeker society."

It had been over three years since the death Panichuros, and so the colonial magistrate sent word to the locals in order to remind them that they were still a province of the Zani Empire. A man by the name of Chorchuros was delegated as the new governor, and he proved to the mage-folk that imperial authority meant ruin for them. Chorchuros was strict in enforcing the ant-mage laws that were inherent to his station, stripping away all the rights that magicians had accumulated under Panichuros' reign. This eventually boiled down into an uprising, one in which the forces of arcane had saw themselves triumph over the legions of the colonial magistrate. Yet, Eresemia was but an island in a sea of mage-fearing peoples, and this conflict was nothing more than a battle of attrition, one in which the Eresmites were doomed to lose. As such, people began leaving for the frontiers of the south, heading for the marshlands in full number. Yet to travel through imperial lands was a prospect most menacing, which made Elogus' compassion even more precious that it would have. A merchant by profession, Elogus possessed caravans travelling all throughout Weaglia, of which he used to secretly hide refugees seeking to flee the colonia regime. His followers are thus composed mainly of the descendents of said runaway mages, who at the moment of being greeted among Seeker society, were adamant in his inclusion as a zastan."

From those belligerent bands of orcs and gobfolk, to the more amiable peoples of elfs and dwarfs, he made all he came across subservient to the name of Zanis without shedding so much as a single drop of blood. Under Palchuas' command, those neophytic fae became known as Legio Weaglia Xenos, the army of the inhuman righteous. Though they were legion by name alone, and were not truly affiliated with colonial military, they still still aided their co-religionists in the many conflicts that plagued the early colonies. The bloodlines of these nonhumans have since become indistinct from those of their mannish counterparts, yet the tactics and weaponry sourced from their respectives cultures are still under common use within both the Nazanite military and those of the Seeker Orders.

Myths abound claiming that she could relay messages into the minds of other people, others say that she could levitate with the grace of a gliding leaf in the wind. Regardless, her distinct abilities as a mage allowed her to pursue a life of nomadism and secrecy, always on the move for one reason or the other. At least, that's how it had gone for nearly her whole life, for during her stay in the village of Umubrei the settlement had been forced into a state of turmoil as a host of bandits had been terrorizing the area for many months. Comeplled by virtues once unfounded in her vagabond heart, Chriochatsem dedicated many her time there in rooting out the raiders wherever they could be found, defending the people as their local hero. Still, her kindness was in turn repaid with deception, as the Inquisitor Order soon strolled in one day, intent on slaying the child as sought to flee one last time.

Supposedly called upon by a higher power, he enlisted himself among the many relief causes that served to help those who were left ruined in the wake of Oskot's fury. For his deeds he was made a figure of great virture and love, the descendents of those soldiers who followed him then becoming split, sect choosing to remain in the colonial provinces, while there other set off into the west, eventually joining up with the Seeker Orders."

Having lived during the days of the Nazani Federation, he was once a cleric before his title had been stripped by the bishopric of Bharramuntacho. Made destitute, it is said that he turned to cheap vices in order to retain what little vitality he had left. Yet, his heart was made animate once more when he was visited by a spirit who left the young man his own provident truths. With zeal surpassing that of the cowed priests, Pirutanta realized the corrupt nature of the Zanite clergy and its willingness to forgo their virtues in the face of bribery from their secular counterpart. As such, the former cleric became determined to see the wrongs his old colleagues had committed be undone, and so took up the profession of a wandering madman within the courts of men. He became their sense of reason, speaking out against editcs of moral complacency. Those of the lower classes loved him so, believing him to be their voice in the politics of estranged nobles. His deeds, however, saw to it that he be exiled from the lands of the federation, send westwards with a troupe of loyal followers into the Dragon Valley, where he became a beloved poet among the half-orcs who lived there.

Yet, despite the nature of his profession, he was not adhered to the anti-magic laws that held sway over the kingdom politics of Weaglia. In contrast, he saw fit that all peoples regardless of race and class were allowed to partake in the usage of the mystic arts. He only desired that those who misused the arcane were to be aprehended, for there were many people who sought to utilize their newfound abilities as mages to harm one another. Achuschunto thus possessed his own state-sponsored mage-academy in order to spread the teachings of magic through a safe yet inclusive manner, garnering students from all across the federation's settlements. He and his fillowers aided in the war against the Razani Reconquista, dying in battle to the last man.

They thus functioned as collaborators with the invading army, earning for themselves a place within the proceeding government. Yet, Pelanda did not share her clan's enthusiasm for the occupation of their homeland. Educated and well versed in the art of debate, she used her status in order to make pleas with the magisters, daring to elevate the rights of all citizens. She then sponsored those remaining mage institutions that survived the ravaging of the Razanites, making an ally of her contemporary intellectuals. She and her colleagues led numerous marches in protest of what they believed to be a cruel and unjust regime, eventually earning them a place among the many martyred heroes of the prior war. Sent to the grave at such a young age, Pelanda is remembered well by the descendents of both fringe members of her houshold and as well as her allies, most of which ended up migrating westwards at the rumor of a league of free-cities who stood against the Zanites, these being the Seeker Order.""

Having been forced into the role of militant labor, her spouse had died during the construction of a magister's personal villa rather than to claim glory in the storm of battle as was expected from the rhetoric that spewed from the mouth of conscriptors. Apparently mauled to death by the estateman's captive lion, the aristrocrat had sought to make for himself a personal arena brimming with an array bestial combatants, despite the numerous complaints and please issued by the soldiers under his command. With rage shooting from the corner of her heart, Penrachea brought together a rabble of widows and veterans of the colonial legions, demanding for the suspension and execution of her husband's superior. It all fell apart soon after, with both Penrachea and a slew of her followers were put down by a band of nameless thugs.

The Razanites, unnacustomed to the wild beasts that inhabited the wilds of colonial Weaglia, were quick to employ the talented hunter in all cases of bestial nuissance. The jobs he took led him to slay barbarous lions, claim the pelts of malicious cave bears, and hang from his body a necklace made from the teeth of murdered wolves. He grew so proficient in his wanton slaughter of the local predators that the spirits of the land grew enraged with his trasngressions. With guile disguised under the form of an ethereal monsters, possessed of the head of a dog and the body of a tiger, Chanald was finally bested by this harvenger sent by nature. Yet, it did not slay him, nor did it compel him to slay the Raanites in turn, rather it taught him how to speak with the animals of the land, allowing him to peacefully divert them away from the grazing grounds of men. He thus taught his people this trick, which then further spread among the colonial ranchers who inhabited the Razani Empire. This technique then evolved into the magical tradition known as 'Beast Speech', the content of its practices being thus endowed upon the Seeker Orders when came the great exodus of aspirant mages from the colonies of the east, taking with them their worship of Chanald too."

Yet, in spite of his own social upbringing, the young man first became the acting sheriff of his quaint village home. Possessed of qualities both noble and strong, he was still a ragged youth and acted uncouth on many such ocassions, stirring fights with nearby villages in the name of his kinsmen's honor. Thus, when the brazen Oskot led his army down from the mountains to the west and brought ruin to Weaglia, it is said that local council, as was appointed by the province's centre administation, demanded that the villagers take up arms against the invading orc menace. Enraged by their disregard for the lives of his people, Viagatri and a band of his followers slew the council men and evacuated the village far into the eastern woodlands. There they eeked out an existence as wildmen who sustained themselves through the many wild plants and prey fauna that abound in those forests. Viagatri chose to keep his kinsmen here for many years even after the Orc Years had ended, fearing for the reprisal they would all earn if their crime would be discovered. Everyday he was consumed by grief for the life he had condemned his fellows too, and would always pray from morning to night asking for a way to ease their burderns. The native spritis, compelled by by his sorrow, granted him a piece of their power, allowing him to become a druid of immense foresight.

From the turmoil many foul things stepped forwards from the chilly slopes of the Wall of God Mountains, rogue mages became spurned by the Razanites, and many more among the regular folk had simply turned to banditry. Possessed of noble attributes not typically seen among sell-swords, Anaphendiag led his people to rid the land of all who ailed it. Riding upon his blood-red steed, the legendary Astuxop, the daring captain broke the lines of thuggish armies time and time again, then repelled those raiding orcs who crossed the dreaded barrier, and had even made peace with those scorned magicians, smuggling them westwards into the arms of the Celtican tribes who were eager to accept them. The people of Weaglia loved him and his warrior troupe, and had even urged him to help them whenever the colonial magistrate proved too burdensome to handle. The magisters, having caught wind of their deeds, deemed Anaphendiag and his men to be dangerous and summarily ordered their aprehension by the local legionaires. Caught unaware within the city of Beneton, the Dunyducreg warriors were slaughtered to a man when away from their beloved mounts, their righetous leader having his head taken for all to bear witness to within the city's centre. Those mages whom Anaphendiag had spared caught wind of his death, and filled with sorrow and grief they went about propagating his legend all throughout the western wilds of Morrigon, his name being then transmitted into the minds of the Seeker folk by word of the Dragon Valley's native half-orcs."

The valleys and the plains once more became fertile as vegetation ran through it with mystical tenacity, engendering a foundation for settleled lifestyle once more. He taught the many survivors of the land to work in tandem with nature, teaching them sustainable methods of agriculture and forestry, entrusting his mortal brethren with the duty of upholding the sacred balance that was nature's own spirit. When his work was complete in those lands, he took with him a retinue of druids westwards into the Dragon Valley, there they pushed out the Dunyducreg barbarians and chased away their dragon lords, setting the stage for human habitation there for the first time.

With this in mind, the magister summoned forth the Inquisitor Order, decrying Piochora as having harbored mystical abberants with the intent of rising up against the colonial regime. Piochora was quickly detained, tortured for many years within the dank dungeons of the magister's fortress, dying at the age of thirty-one.
