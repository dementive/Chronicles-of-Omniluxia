omen_itdis_desc:0 "Itdis is the pattron of hope and valor, aspects that are highly valued for the constantly persecuted followers of his school. A figure of supposedly mixed heritage, in life he espoused for the unification between the Weaglian natives and the Zanite colonists in order to cast aside the chains of imperial rule. For his acts of dissent, Itdis, alongside other like-minded compatriots of his who too caused problems for the Zani Empire, were rounded-up like cattle and then brutally executed in public. Since then he has been kept in the hearts of those people who remembered his names as they continued to keep alight his memory in the shadows."
