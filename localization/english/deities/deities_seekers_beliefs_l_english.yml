omen_itdis:0 "Zastan Siodisios"
omen_itdis_desc:0 "Siodisios is the patron of hope and unity, virtues that are greatly upheld by the followers of his school. In life he was a man of supposed mixed heritage, espousing for the cooperation between the Morrigian natives and the Zanite colonists with the intent of catsting aside the chains of imperial rule. Not only did he advocate for such ideals, he also wrote many treatises demanding for the emancipation of slaves both mundane and mystical. His advocacies had even led to the famous mage-slave revolt of Eresmia, in which the short lived mage kingdom of the same name had been temporarily revived under the leadership of the legendary Huhiater. Unfortunately, however, his many insitgations of societal uprising were found out, and for his acts of dissent, Siodisios, alongside other like-minded compatriots of his who too caused problems for the Zani Empire, were rounded-up like cattle and then brutally executed in public. Since then he has been kept in the hearts of those people who remembered his names as they continued to keep alight his memory in the shadows."

omen_axnir:0 "Zastan Astonixya"
omen_axnir_desc:0 "The school of Astonixya is beloved and well practiced among the meek and the many, espousing ideas of liberty and resopect for all peoples. Despite this liberal flair inherent to her teachings, even those among the upper echelon of Seeker society still keep Astonixya close in their hearts for her role as the founding mother of their people. For when the Zanites made swell the mines and quarries along their borders with the misery of the magical folk of whom they had enslaved, the brazen druid Astonixya strove forward against this injustice, freeing the countless souls who were squandering their potential in those horrid places. She taught them the secrets to her people's mysticism, combining them with the few occultic traditions that had survived among her Zanite followers. They then roamed across the countryside, striking blows against the colonial legions as they put to torch a hundred slave pens, freeing the denizens within. However, as Astonixya grew weary from years of conflict, she directed her followers to the Dragon Valley, claiming that such a place shall be their new home, thus founding the ancestral people who now make up the Seeker Orders."

omen_qizdite:0 "Zastan Chisitesa"
omen_qizdite_desc:0 "Concerned for the sanctity of all human life, whether arcane or otherwise, Chisitesa was a staunch advocate for the rights of those margianalized mystics within the Zani Empire. She wrote numerous treatises deconstructing the social differences between a magical and mundane person, claiming that the total sum of their personage were equal to one another. She preached for the practical uses of magic, bellowing loudly that societal matters such as fertility and agriculture were heavily reliant on the gatekept traditions of the clergy, and that those born with the innate power to wield magic absent of a god's presence were vital in keeping the nation strong. Unfortunately, Chisitesa was sentenced to death under the false accusations of sowing dissent despite her fierce love for the country that condemned her. Followers of her school are thus loathe to forget her sacrifice and beliefs, displaying strong convictions for their state and practices."

omen_aldir:0 "Zastan Amaltar"
omen_aldir_desc:0 "The lady of the learned folk, Amaltar was in life a wealthy and yet humble woman born to a household of mixed Ytalo-Zani origins. Having emigrated with her kin to the coastal colonies of Weaglia as a young girl, Amaltar grew up on the tales of hedge wizards and wild mages who safeguarded the ancient practices of the land. Fascinated by such things well into her adult life, she utilized her family's wealth to found a magician's haven sanctioned by the local magistrate. Unfortunately, while her actions were by all means legal, the common folk did not view it as such, and would routinely persecute Amaltar and her people as much as they could. Eventually, this would all boil down into violence as Amaltar's familial home was burnt to the ground with her, her kinsmen, and magical wards all inside it. The followers of her school are thus quick to show compassion and understanding, even for those peoples that they could not fully understand."

omen_khidos_desc:0 "The great avenger whose namesake is the word justice, Chistospis was a veteran of the Razani Unification wars. When the conflict came to a cose, he fell madly in love with a Ytalian wizardess by the name of Chiora, wedding the moment she agreed to their union. They then sired into the world twins, one born of the same magical properties that flowed within their mother, and the other having been born with the same mundane essence of their father. Yet tragedy would befall their family, as Chiora was then struck dead in the marketplace, killed by a local inquistor despite her status as a sanctioned mage. Consumed by fury, Chistospis slew the man who had been responsible for his wife's murder. Afterwards he and his children fled for the continent of Weaglia, settling in what was the Nazani Federation. Even here, did Chistospis not relent, hunting those who had dared persecute people like his departed love, making himself a hushed legend among the people and a bane towards inquisitors. His story ended tragically, however, for one of his sons, Chiorupino the mundane one, slew his own brother and then outsed his father to the Nazani inquisitors. The story of this betreyal is thus forever marred into the minds of Chistospis' followers, urging them to seek out vengeance against who would harm a magician."

omen_nirsin:0 "Zastan Naearisios"
omen_nirsin_desc:0 "Naearisios was born a Weaglian mage with the ability to see things that others could not. He saw the spirits of the dead that lingered in the air, he saw essence of one's soul that made animate the flesh, and most importantly he understood the meaning of all material objects as were placed by the gods. Deprived of any great figure of magical intuition, Naearisios' gift was left unnoticed by those around him as he learned to master the powers that were inherent to his being. With his skills made manifest, he took upon himself the life of an architect in order to better the quaint townage of Chanonaes. In time, he was accused by the priests of his village for being a magician in disguise, and was thus sentenced to the local arena to live and die as fodder for the captive beasts that were resigned there. Despite his murder, all because he desired to do good by his people, the followrs of Nirsin are compassionate folk who are always looking for ways to improve the lives of their fellow men."

omen_nova:0 "Zastan Nova"
omen_nova_desc:0 "Said to have wandered the colonial frontiers of Zanite Weaglia, the saintly Nova was a mystical healer who aided the peoples both native and settler, preaching her good word of kindness and good will to all. Those followers of her school claim that she was in fact the vessel by which a mighty spirit sought to help steer the world away from the direction it was headed. Abhorred by the rising sentiment that derided magiciains, the spirit and its ward sought to teach the peoole once more the goodness of magic and all that it had to offer. The colonial inquisitors, however, did not view the pair in the same light as the many people whom they had aided. With violent cruelty, the Zanites bound Nova and killed her, with clerical magic they turned her insides out and her blood into urine. As for her spirit master, they trapped the it deep within an old cistern, of which the disciples of this school search for relentlessly both day and night."

omen_ziarae:0 "Zastan Ziarae"
omen_ziarae_desc:0 "The savior of slaves and the holder of oaths, Ziarae was a sanctioned mage born to a trader who dealt in the flesh of men, sending them far and wide from their homeland of Gaellia. Among those made in bondage were those people who had been ostracised for displaying some level of magical latency that was neither too insignificant to be ignored, nor too dangerous to call upon the inquisitors of the empire. Ziarae, affronted by this debase cruelty, would dedicate many nights in order to lead away those captives from his familial estate. When his father had discovered his acts, it is said that he slew his own son in a fit of rage, only to become overwhelemed by the sensation of grief that he too took his own life in the process. The followers of this school have learnt to follow through on Ziarae's action, holding true to their allegiance to mage kind over one's own direct kindred."

omen_ogzotz:0 "Zastan Oskot"
omen_ogzotz_desc:0 "Distinct in that he is one of the few inhuman saints who make up a quarter of the Seeker schools, Oskot was a half-orc by birth, sired by a Morrigian woman to the chief of the Largaduru. It was during his youth did a terrible plague sweep through the lands of Mowhrighen, taking from the earth thousands of mortal lives. Among the casualties were Oskot's own parents, driving him into a long period of grief in which he had become laden with visions of the dead. From among the hosts of spirits who sought refuge within his mind, there came the voices of his ancestors both orc and man. They proclaimed that this plague was a punishment from the gods, upset that the peoples of the west abandoned their magical traditions in favor of garnering good faith with an empire that sought their subjagation. Filled with fury, Ogzotz rallied the people of the Borderlands, marching them across the Wall of God. He spent years campaiging along the eastern coasts, terrorizing the disorganized Weaglians. In time, he returned west after his rage subsided, migrating his horde all the way to Dragon Valley, where his orc followers became mixed with the native humans, their descendents becoming the Dumnonians. A relatively recent addition, the glory of Ozgozt was brought under the Seeker fold during the intermingling period between the Orcano-Celts and their Zano-Vetali neighbors, and he has since attracted numerous followers who share with him a warlike spirit."

omen_ghiheia_desc:0 "The elven mistress who reared a thousand mannish children, Ghiheia is an obscured saint whose followers are equally indecipherable. Yet, the presence of both can be felt all across wherever the Seeker faith can be found, as if they were spirits hanging in the air, or a voice nestled deep in the earth, ready to help guide the mages of Weaglia in all places they reside. With motives unknown, folklore abounds of a fae enchanteress who stole the children of Zanites and raised them in the ways of magic, teaching them how to control the green around them. Wherever one wanders into the woods of western Weaglia at night, to hear the voices of singing children allows one to know where they have managed to intrude upon. If you be a person of mundane properties, it would be advisable for you to leave immediately. Yet, for those men and women who have magic flowing through their veins, the children of the woods would be more than accepting of you and the potential you bring."

omen_walthos:0 "Zastan Walthos"
omen_walthos_desc:0 "The saintly merchant, Walthos was in life a humble peddler who would travel across the colonies of Weaglia in search of the magical trinkets that were made by his Morrigian ancestors. These items were often the loot stolen by the Zanite legions during their conquests of Mowhrighen and beyond, items which Walthos was more than glad to return to his estranged kinsfolk who continued to vie against the colonial powers. His trade was not only restricted to goods and baubles, but as well in people, for he would buy from the cruel slavers of Weaglia their cringing stock, taking with him at least a coupe hundred of slaves, of whom he had brought to the tribes of Mowhrighen and were thus welcomed by their new tribal community. Unlike many of the Seeker saints, however, his good deeds were not rewarded with a tragic death, and was instead allowed to die in peace surrounded by the companions he made along his journey. Walthos' followrers are composed most often by the merchant folk of Seeker society, who always strive to follow his example in retrieving magical artifacts to be cherished and well guarded."

omen_obium_desc:0 "Obium was in life a Zanite priestess who dedicated herself to serving the needy and the poor, the downtrodden and the oppressed. she spent many years fighting in the name of not only the mundane folk, but as well as those mystical individuals who were spurned by the government. Using her jurisprudence as a holy woman, she helped sanction numerous magical beings from the prying influence of the inquisitors, saving countless lives from their devase cruelty. Her noble efforts, however, led to her being targeted by her fellow clergy folk, who were upset that she sought to diminish their authority in the realm of magic. They accused her of worshipping demons, condemmed her for cavorting with wild mages, and sentenced her to be shipped towards the colonies of Weaglia as slave labor. Yet still, even though she was chained below the rotting deck of a privateer ship, Obium insitgated an uprising among her fellow serviles, leading them to take command of the vessel. As if saved by divine providence, the boat led them to the marshland shores of Mowrighen, where the Zanite freemen became mxed with the local marshlanders, becoming the Sadasizi. The school Obium is thus fairly attractive to Morrigians and former slaves, of which those folk often preach to others the virtures of bravery and fortitude."

omen_parimades:0 "Zastan Parimades"
omen_parimades_desc:0 "Parimades was a Zanite magician born in the capital city of Durobaeraste, sanctioned to serve as a battlemage within the colonial legions of fair Weaglia, only to turn traitor and run off into the wilderness where he spent the rest of his life fighting a geurilla war against his own people. Sired to the illustrious house of Paritoas as auspicious moonlight shone down upon his home, he was blessed by the gods themselves with magic. Though normally, such children are neutralized by the inquisitors, the wealth and influence of the Paritoas kept them away from their beloved child. As such, Parimades was given the proper supervision to regulate the power flowing within him, granted protection by the emperor of the time himself. Parimades was thus enlisted in the imperial army, and was soon transferred to help supress uprisings in the western frontiers. It was here Parimades became disgusted with the treatment as was inflicted upon his fellow magic users, questioning his own ideas of what it meant to be a mage under Zanite authority. When the poortunity first presented itself, Parimades deserted his regiment and fled into the woodland dark, rubbing elbows with the Mowhrighen mystics as they did battle with the inquisitors who hunted them. He thus a becme a wandering legend among the peoples of the old west, derided by his mundane counterparts, yet an inspiration to those followers of his school."

omen_achrianoc:0 "Zastan Eachrianoc"
omen_achrianoc_desc:0 "Born in a time when the marshlands of Weaglia were under the authority of foreign imperialism, Eachrianoc, a Morrgian noble of the Corwyrog folk, had always possessed aspirations of native sovereignty even from a young age. The last born son of Chief Eaberand, Eachrianoc was the least liekly to inherit any land upon his father's death, and was thus not requested to accompany his brothers during their time as hostages of the Zanite colonial magistrate. It was only after the death of his father did both of his siblings return, yet they would not be unapposed. Despite being only thirteen at the time, Eachrianoc possessed of rage like a raven and the stubborness of a boar, Eachrianoc bellowed that his brothers were unfit of their father's chiefdom, claiming that they had become submissive to the reign of the Zanites. His people, composed of similar sentiments, chased away their would-be leaders, and instead swore themselves to young firebrand. With staunch bravery, Eahrianoc chose to allign his people with the likes of Axnir the soothsayer to the north, eventually following her into the Dragon Valley after their successive campaigns together. The modern followers of his school are often composed of psionics and military commanders, always seeking to glimmer for themselves a better understanding of his tactics and wisdom."

omen_asazantur:0 "Zastan Asazantur"
omen_asazantur_desc:0 "A vagabond mage-king of Phanician descent, Asazantur was an exceptional individual whose legacy is still remembered most especially among the mystical folk of Weaglia, enough so to have been posthumously dubbed the title of zastan within the Seeker faith. While a bandit through and through, he was righteous in who he pillaged and who he protected, lending his aid to the downtrodden and weak whilst making sure imperial institutions such as the inquisitors were most often the victims of his daring raids. With a warband composed primarily of Celticans and Silver Dwarves, Asazantur is reminisched fondly even in the myths and stories of these two peoples for his crusade against the foreign power that had come into the west. A man known for both his golden tongue and golden heart, he was once able to swindle a land owner out of nearly all of his wealth and nothing more than words alone, giving away all such goods to the people  without fears of reprisal from the then destitute baron, his minions having thus left his barren state for the company of Aszantur. His followers are thus often jesters, merchants, and eccentrics, whose words are just as tricky in the ways of oratory."

omen_palpaduav_desc:0 "The great provider, Palpaduav was a Celtican druid who offered immense aid to those renegade mage clans who dared stand up the Zani Empire. Able to make bend the oaks and green, Palpaduav bent the woodlands to his will in order to provide safe passage for his magician allies, able to create pathways that confounded the likes of the imperial inquisitors, and yet gave way for those seeking to curb their influence. It is said that most Seeker alchemical traditions can trace their origins back to Palpaduav, who taught the fleeing Zanite mages which herbs and fruits were edible, and which ones were not, helping prevent death and sickness whenever he could for the already diminished mage populations who roamed the woodlands of Weaglia. The followers of Palpaduav is composed almost entirely of doctors and alchemists, who always look to further expand both their own personal knowledge, and as well as socital knowledge through preaching their lores."

omen_atachupio:0 "Zastan Atachupio"
omen_atachupio_desc:0 "Remembered for saving the defenders of Supoluan castle, Atachupio was the daughter of the former battlemage Atuanta. Born in a time when the provinces of Weaglia were just still recovering from the dreaded Orc Years, the young girl was exposed to all sorts of political discourse within the confines of her own home. Many landowners were dismayed when the imperial legions failed to muster any resistance against the pillaging barbarians, and thus chose to try and break away from the colonial magistrate in an attempt to establish their own fiefdoms. Atachupio's father was one such man, counted among the list of failed warlords during the Interregnum. Forced to retreat within his last citadel, a siege thus ensued that lasted for over three months before Atachupio came into agreement with the besiegers, asking for safe passage for the local women and all that their oxen may carry. With this agreement made, the castle's women hurled upon the backs of their steeds the bods of their battered husbands and fathers, their brothers and uncles, hidden under the ancient tapestries of Supoluan. They were thus able to escape northwards into the lands of the Fidiaio, thus becoming the Fideli people. The Seeker school of Atachupio is thus often attended by diplomats, politicians, and orators who pray to her spirit, asking for the same suave thinking that compelled her that day"

deity_balbatoc:0 "$omen_balbatoc$"
omen_balbatoc:0 "Zastan Balbatoc"
omen_balbatoc_desc:0 "A Celtican madman and mystic, Balbatoc was truly possessed of a broken mind. Deemed the greatest trickster of his era, on par with the mythical rogues of Mowrighen's many ancient folktales. It is said that he could make water dry by singing, giving it a despicable texture that could sap the moisture out of anything, and that air would turn solid if he so wished for it, making the lungs of his foes become burdened with a terrible pain. Regardless, the many people who surrounded themselves with his company claimed that he was possessed of a delightful aura, able to make smile even the most downtrodden of people. Many myths abound claiming that he was the avatar of some forgotten god who had become displeased with the arrival of the Zanites. Yet, despite such intriguing tales, Balbatoc was made famous most especially for his power to confound the natural laws of mankind and turn the fleshen cadavers of men into a cleansed and consumable product. He taught this bale technique to the many desperate mages who fled from the Zanite colonies, his teachings eventually culminating into the many schools of blood magic that circulate withint Seeker society. These followers of Balbatoc, while often shunned by most people, have gained for themselves clerical recognition from the reigning Seeker states, and have grown in number over the ages."

omen_panichuros:0 "Zastan Panichuros"
omen_panichuros_desc:0 "A preacher who not meant for the world he was born in, Panichuros was a Weaglian politician who believed in the rights of all mage throughout the colonies. Though a magistrate by profession, Panichuros rarely adhered himself to the anti-mage laws that permeated the careers of his fellow governors, and so sent word across the frontiers that his lands were safe for any mage who sought refuge. As such, his once meager province of Eresem became a hotspot of magical innovation and lifestyle, being dubbed as 'Wizard's Country' by the surrounding territories. Many of his rivals claimed that he was in fact seeking to produce his own personal mage army, aiming to overthrow the colonial government. But such accusations simply fell on deaf ears, as neighboring governors did not seem to care where the magicians went, only that they travel far away from their own holdings. In time, Eresem became largely independent not by means of insurrection, but rather due to sheer neglect on part of the Zani Empire's aversion to mages. This allowed for the shortly lived state of Eresemia, a nation in all but name. He is remembered fondly by the likes of the magister-kings of Dragon Valley, who pray to him that their state shall forever prosper."

omen_oruhalla_desc:0 "Composed of virtues both pleasent and compassionate, Oruhalla was descendent of the old warrior assemblies whose influence once permeated across the pre-Zanite lands of Eagalia. He was distinct in his position in that he genuinely strove to uphold the values of his equestrian ancestors, striving to be annointed knighthood just as his forebears were. He was thus dispatched as another levied commander in sevice of the emperor, sent to annihilate the unruly tribes of the Rohenoans. Whereas his companions showed derision for the so called 'backwards folk' of the west, Oruhalla was saintly in that he chose to spare those innocent lives of the violence that lept from the souls of his warriors. He dedicated many nights arguing with his superiors, demanding that they should treat the conquered peoples with kindness. He claimed that the best way to subdue them was to win over their genuine loyalty, going so far as to volunteer himself to serve as their magistral representative. Though many decried him with fierce oppositition, suspecting that they he had sought the title in order to lead his own rebellion, the emperor himself relented. Oruhalla thus laid the first kindlings that led to the genesis of the many syncretic peoples of the western continent, and is thus viewed as a founding father among such cultures. His followers are comprised of the many social castes within Seeker society, with no one caste claiming him to be their patron due to his nature as the father of Morrigiano-Zani."

Born to one of the emperor's many consorts, when her powers were simply feeble, the clergy discovered her nature and demanded that she, and her mother, be handed to the Inquisitor Order. Her father, Imperator Tosovochio, refused to yield either his consort and child to the cruelties of the clergy, and so created a new law, one which allowed all emperors, current and proceeding, to grant sanctions upon certain magical individuals if they so choose to. Though faced with much public backlash, enough so as to warrant a civil war that nearly brought the empire to it's knees, Imperator Tosovochio stood firm in his decision in order to keep his beloved Sadinupa safe. The girl in question, however, did not remain idle in her time within the imperial palace. With guile that many suspect to have been magical in nature, she used her words alone to make parley with the relatives of rebels who had stayed in the capital city of Durobaeraste. She used them to help convince many of the rebel factions to stand down and submit to the emperor, turning the tide of war for the better. Her followers primarily consist of noble women among the Seeker heirarchy, prayed to by expecting mothers who wish fot their child to possess the same magical properties as Sadinupa."

Dubbed a pan, a wizard in the western tongues of Intermarenicia, and in spite of the growing anti-mage sentiments that were brewing all across the Zani Empire, Garapagon was adamant in his quest to bring good fortune to the people of the west. In the few myths that survived him, it is believed that he was compelled by a higher power in order to prepare the people of Weaglia for the day of salvation. He preached that the Zani Empire was bound to die, that one day another great catastrophe would befall it as the Great Collapse of Omniluxia had struck once prior. Yet, despite his apocalytpic foretellings, Garapagos was a kind and hunmble man, who is said to have worked alongside the many freefolk who filled the colonies, performing miracles and healing the sick. Yet his teachings could not be left unbothered in the eyes of the Zanite inquisitors, who publicly tortured him, demanding that he retract what they believed to be false words. Garapagon, place his faith and duty above all else, chose instead to let the inquisitors brutally kill him with each laceration of the whip, bleeding out as he looked upwards to his god.

She sought to safeguard the rights of those mages who had been falsely accused by the Inquisitor Order, testifying and fighting in their name and thus saving them from an assured execution in the gladiator pits. Still, she was a lawyer who as well served the comman man, and was thus lauded by even the mundane folk who would have otherwise been disgusted by her actions as a savior of mages, and thus evaded death on a number of occasions due to her support from the people, able to live well into her old age as she died peacefully.

He initially spent ten years of his life working within the Zanite capital of Durobaeraste, rearing the next generation of theologians and scholars, of scientists and alchemists. In secret, however, there was one subject of which he was forbidden to teach, and yet was compelled to do so regrdless. In hiding he taught to those sanctioned mages the secrets to his clerical magic, allowing them to make use of their once unused potential. Erandas was eventually discovered one faithful morning, his auditorium then stormed by a members onf Inquisitor Order. He claimed that he was simply upholding the truth of his god, of all gods, that all peoples had the right to learn. This, of coure, fell on deaf ears within the imperial courtroom, and Erandas was susbequently executed the next morning. The school of Erandas is thus often reserved to those belonging to the teacher caste, though its tenants are also adhered to by expecting parents who wish to rause their children auspicously."

When the farmlands that provided for the city people had been burnt, there came a time of great famine, leading to a period of intense banditry as the people grew ever more desperate in those struggling times, with some going so far as to allign themselves with the greenskin menance that brought ruin to their homes. Tasked with shielding those innocents of the time, Pichosinma was one of the many defenders of Temundos castle, the last line of defense for those territories down south of it. Thus, when an Orcanite sub-captain led a daring raid against the fortress, one in which the local commander had been slain by a traitorous contingent of Zanites, it is said that Pichosinma took command of his then panicking subordinates, thus executing those who had dared betrayed their oath to defend the people. Though this would not stop the besiegers from breaching the walls, under Pichosinma's leadership they routed the invaders, taking the heads of a hundred orcs in the process. The surrounding villges, comeplled by awe for this man's dedication and spirit, pooled together their dwindling resources in order to rebuild the castle.

Five monsters were his count on that day, the pelts he skinned from them thus adorning his armor to signify his status as a slayer of aberrant beasts. With his warhammer made ascendent in the realm of myth, Anichures became brazen in his quest to hunt down the creatures of the Wall of God, taking with him all who were eager to claim glory as he did. In their quest to their mountainous hunting grounds, Anichures made tidings with a tribe of Morrigians who, after becoming awe stricken by the gryphons pelts that bedecked his stature, joined him on his epic quest to slay monsters to the western mountains. Through caverns they ventured, in the old dwarven tunnels did they find devils that were laid there. The many tendrilled cadavers, the scuttling ones with slimy ichor, and the feral ghouls who stalked the underground with wolf-like prowess, all these and more were made eradicated by this band of adventurers. After a year of hunting, Anichures led his people back to Piron, settling the tribal folk who accompanied him, laying the foundations for soon to be city Pironuia.

A man by the name of Chorchuros was delegated as the new governor, and he proved to the mage-folk that imperial authority meant ruin for them. Chorchuros was strict in enforcing the ant-mage laws that were inherent to his station, stripping away all the rights that magicians had accumulated under Panichuros' reign. This eventually boiled down into an uprising, one in which the forces of arcane had saw themselves triumph over the legions of the colonial magistrate. Yet, Eresmia was but an island in a sea of mage-fearing peoples, and this conflict was nothing more than a battle of attrition, one in which the Eresmites were doomed to lose. As such, people began leaving for the frontiers of the south, heading for the marshlands in full number. Yet to travel through imperial lands was a prospect most menacing, which made Elogus' compassion even more precious that it would have. A merchant by profession, Elogus possessed caravans travelling all throughout Weaglia, of which he used to secretly hide refugees seeking to flee the colonia regime. His followers are thus composed mainly of the descendents of said runaway mages, who at the moment of being greeted among Seeker society, were adamant in his inclusion as a zastan."

omen_palchuas_desc:0 "An icon to all clerics within fair Weaglia, Palchuas was in life a member of the warrior priesthood dedicated to Zanis, having then travlled to the barbarian west with the intent of indoctrinating its peoples to the Zanite cause. Possessed of zeal uncompromising, the words that flew from his mouth bore allegiance to no name but that of the God-Emperor, making themselves known to even those who did not share any semblance to the human spirit. From those belligerent bands of orcs and gobfolk, to the more amiable peoples of elfs and dwarfs, he made all he came across subservient to the name of Zanis without shedding so much as a single drop of blood. Under Palchuas' command, those neophytic fae became known as Legio Weaglia Xenos, the army of the inhuman righteous. Though they were legion by name alone, and were not truly affiliated with colonial military, they still still aided their co-religionists in the many conflicts that plagued the early colonies. The bloodlines of these nonhumans have since become indistinct from those of their mannish counterparts, yet the tactics and weaponry sourced from their respectives cultures are still under common use within both the Nazanite military and those of the Seeker Orders. Within wizard society in particular, the carriers of the fae blood have since inegrated the patron of their ancestors as a zastan, making him the patron of all inhuman races."

A mage of unknown category, many Seeker historians strive to condense all that they know about her mystical properties under a concise label, a task which proves more daunting than it appears. Myths abound claiming that she could relay messages into the minds of other people, others say that she could levitate with the grace of a gliding leaf in the wind. Regardless, her distinct abilities as a mage allowed her to pursue a life of nomadism and secrecy, always on the move for one reason or the other. At least, that's how it had gone for nearly her whole life, for during her stay in the village of Umubrei the settlement had been forced into a state of turmoil as a host of bandits had been terrorizing the area for many months. Comeplled by virtues once unfounded in her vagabond heart, Chriochatsem dedicated many her time there in rooting out the raiders wherever they could be found, defending the people as their local hero. Still, her kindness was in turn repaid with deception, as the Inquisitor Order soon strolled in one day, intent on slaying the child as sought to flee one last time. Chirochatsem's followers, while often quick to distrust those who do not follow the Seeker faith, tend to be righteous in their martial inclinations, composed of those peasent warriors who make swell the milities of the Seeker Orders."

When Fediandes collected from the people their due wealth, he did not do so without first asking what it is they desired their money to be spent on. Always ready to let the complaints and wants of the people to fall upon himself, he was humble in his service to both people and state. Though a meager man of an more meager position, he fought for his fellow city-folk of Roehoio, bellowing forth a slew of passionate legislations, from the construction of public baths to to the sponsoring of the lower-class. He was adamant in elevating the common man, even going so far as to dedicate his own wealth as to improve and refurbish many of the old cateries, workshops, and households of Roehoio's slums. His most saintly deed of all, however, was his compassion for mages, for not even the mystical folk were spared the dew of his kindness. His home became refugee for a hundred or so former slaves of magical origin, fighting for each one of their legal sanctions. He died comfortably of old age under the stewardship and care of his mage allies, no macabre plot was sent against him by any percieved rivals or angered inquisitors. His school is thus often filled by members of the taxman caste, who strive to uphold the virtues of his saintly lifestyle."

Not only that, her establishment often acted as a hostel and orphanage, taking in the many Morrigian tribals who sought to emigrate from the west when a dreaded plague began sweeping through the land. Without a patron to sponser their entry into wider Zanite society, these migrants would have been no more than second class citizens lest they choose to remain along the borders where danger is most rife. Yet, out of her own charitable nature, Daialoba worked hard in order to ensure that every person who dropped by her home were allowed equal footing once they headed down south, pulling both her own wealth and assorted allies from the years prior. Many people who possess Morrigian ancestry dating the to the early periods of Zanite colonsation often look up to her as their patron zastan, always looking to uphold her level of kindness in their own everyday lives. Her incusion among the Seeker saints was induced by a westward migration of mixed peoples who had began fleeing heavy persecution from the rising Nazanite Federation, later turned into a monarchy."

The wife of a wealthy landowner, she when her husband perished during the Orc Years his land became hers by writ of law, a claim which was derisively contested by both her in-laws and neighboring estatesmen. To combat such threats, she invited from all across the lands migratory mages in hiding in order to both till and protect the land. With her own enormous wealth, she sponsored those magicians who flocked to her side, aiding them as they now aided her. Under her command, those arcane farmers began experimenting new ways in order to better produce sizeable yields. Together they created a hundred or so different methods of cross pollination that were exclusive only to those wizened in the ways of magic, growing dazzling breeds of vegetables that were desired from as far away as the lands of Baetep. When the founders of the Nazanite Federation rose up and began implementing extreme and persecutory laws targeting mages and mixed peoples, Daialoba was one of the many migrants who chose to emigrate westwards into the lands of the Seeker Orders, taking with her both her followers and agricultural methods, of which she gladly lent to her new hosts in the west.

He was a soul composed of all the knightly virtues, said to have been a terror to his enemies yet an indomitable hero in the eyes of his comrades. Even when strayed far from the battlefield, the man did not relent in this belligerent conduct, know to have found himself in more than a single brawl once in a while. Still, these acts were not indicative of the total sum of his person, for more often than he did fight did he choose to sow compassion wherever he could. A patron of the poor, Anipandre proved to be a man of infinite charity, for in his spare time did dedicate large sums of his wealth to those who needed it. Death, however, would choose to reap itself upon this fine soul without much justification. Struck down in defense of wizard kind after the fall of Eresmia, he chose to defect from his militant oaths, facing off against his former cohorts alongside a small band of loyal brothers. It is for this rightous act do many Seekers choose to revere this man as a zastan, his adherants composed primarilly of the knightly castes."

The child begged to be a follower of his militant savior, praising him for his just compassion. Yet Anipandre did not relent, believing the boy was still too young and thus directed him under the care of a nearby orphanage. Abaxias, however, did not give up on his knightly dreams, swearing upon himself to uphold the values of his would-be master, sowing justice wherever he went. When he came of age, he chose to enlist going the clerical order of Goaripa,  group of warrior monks who swore themselves to no god. Under their stern tutelage did Abaxias become a man of stout integrity and martial prowess, going on to lend his aid to the mage revolt of Eresmia. He perished in the following conflicts, but not before announcing himself a hero to the world. Having won ten battles, it is said that he personally slew up to fifteen sub-commanders of the Zanite legions. It was only after the siege of Eresmia's capital was he captured, sentenced to be decapitated by none other than Anipandre himself. Abaxias is duly revered as the patron of lost cuases and undying hope, and is thus taken up by members of the squire caste charged with the duty of upholding their liege's cause."

In the aftermath of the conflict, he volunteered his contingent to be dispatched among those places hit hardest by the orcs. Aiding the disparate who were left less fortunate by the eve of war, Poabanis spent three years rebuilding ruined townages and dispatching supplies to the impovrished. For these acts and more, Poabanis was beloved by the people who began flocking to him like a god. Even those who were left relatively untouched by the Orc Years began admiring him, with hundreds of city-folk rallying to him whenever he would stop by their homes, donating what they could to help. His rising figure would be painted as treasonous by those jealous civil officiers. Though they had always claimed that Poabanis had been stirring up rebellion, it was only after he aided the people of Eresmia was his intent viewed as treachery. Eresmia was a hated place to many, and to conceive that a military officer had sought out to aid what was a glorified slave estate consisting of the most derided group in the empire, it alarmed a few members of the Inquisitor Order. With swift action, Poabanis ws stripped of his rank, his men then merged with another warband of the colonial legions. Poabanis was later trialed for the accusation of sowing dissent, and thus had the estates and wealth he earned during the prior war confiscated, leaving him destitue until he disappeared from the historical record entirely. Many Seekers who claim ancestry from the later Zanite migrations to the west make up the majority of Poabanis' followers, dubbed the patron to those military strongmen among them."

Yet, despite his utter opposition to the empire he once fought for, he still remained in all circumstances pleasant and amiable towards the common folk of said polity. When the magistrates proved too burdensome for the people to stand up against, it was often Chalchichi who worked on behalf of them, performing death defying tricks upon local authorities. From 'The Scare of Sianundros' to the murder of the cruel Chaianacrhes, Chalchichi's justice was harsh to those men of power who sought to abuse their positions. Yet, never once was he caught, never once did he falter, for one day he would disappear for ten months without giving so much as the slightest clue to those imperial forces who hunted him. When he returned, however, he returned truly with a vengeance. He reappeared within the capital of the Zani Empire, Durobaeraste, the same day in which Imperator Talchantro was murdered. Though he once more did he flee into places unknown never to be seen again, most people have come to assumption that he did indeed kill the emperor that day. The followers of his school are many and increasingly popular with the youth, who reared upon the tales of this mystic vigilante."

When the Dunyducreg of the south traveled north upon their chariots of bronze, they did so with martial intent in mind. In the Morrigian swamos did they enslave whole cities, creating an era of foreign warlords upon foreign land. They then pounced upon the borders of the Zani Empire, doing so through punitive raids that saw many citizens taken away as blood sacrifice for their bale gods. The magistrate could not allow such crimes to go unchecked, and thus called for the reigning general of the time, Caturtuntos. He was then slain in battle by the Dunyducreg king, Aminaxes, setting chaos to the campaign yet blooded. Rising to the challenge, Leasinto subdued his fleeing comrades, making them heel to his name alone in order to drive back the southern menace. With gusto unparalleled, he thrashed the Dunyducreg so badly as to invade their homeland itself, propping up a number of puppet states in the Morrigian marshes as he went. Among the southern plains did he establish the Soveneria dynasty, and was in theory subservient to the colonial government, yet in reality he acted wholly independent. The descendents of his army are believed to have traveled northwards into the lands of the Seeker Orders, who readily placated them by assigning Leasinto the status of zastan."
