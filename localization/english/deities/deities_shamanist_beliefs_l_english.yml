omen_lierin:0 "Lierin"
omen_lierin_desc:0 "Lierin was a goddess of swordsmanship in the ancient times. In contemporary times, her role and message did not change much at all. Whether prophet or goddess, she derived her power from the mastery of the sword. #G Sserstryss#!'s blessings relate to his original powers, and thus, people say that Lierin is a representation of discipline, honor, and patience.\n\nLierin was known to take on students. Many would die under her harsh and vigerous tutelage, but it did create a long-lasting caste of warriors called #Y The Kobras#!. By the time of #R Zyalassr#!, these #Y Kobras#! had already faded into myth."

omen_dhogher:0 "Khokar"
omen_dhogher_desc:0 "Khokar was considerred a god far after the rise of #R Zyalassr#!. Sometimes, Khokar is even called 'The Last God.' He lived in an isolated island in the south, and had gathered a small cult of followers. His nature in it of itself was considerred divine. He could seemingly control the will of people around him. Eventually though, when his message seeped outside his native island, he was assassinated and killed. The earlier days of #R Zyalassr#!'s religion were a time of fragmenting unity.\n\nIt was only much later when Khokar was recognized as a prophet representing #G Sserstryss#! supposed power of persuasion. Some still don't consider him a prophet, but the majority of snakekind have accepted him as canon."

deity_sserstryss:0 "$omen_sserstryss$"
omen_sserstryss:0 "Ssertryss"
omen_sserstryss_desc:0 "It is said long ago, #Y World-Serpents#! roamed the land, however, they were neither immortal nor able to reproduce. Overtime, the #Y World-Serpents#!dwindled, but one remained; Sserstryss. From this #Y World-Serpent's#! corpse eventually formed the #E Austropetolian Archipelago#!. Its blood became the water, splitting landmasses from each other. Its eyes became the two mountains of #E Etrorg and Agreer#!. And from its skin spawned a miracle, the #E Ular-Pria#!.\n\nIn ancient snake times, there existed a pantheon, beings who held divine-like power. However, over time, these 'gods' became more like prophets, one of which was named #R Zyalassr#!. He would explain that the gods are not truly gods, but like him, chosen snakes to lead snakekind in the name of Sserstryss. While the cult of #R Zyalassr#! was originally quite small, as more and more 'prophets' repeated his message, it was canonized, and Ssertryss became the only deity within the #T Velkopic#! pantheon."

deity_qadon:0 "$omen_qadon$"
omen_qadon:0 "Kytun"
omen_qadon_desc:0 "Kytun was a prophet during the times right after the cult of #R Zyalassr#! rose to prominence. During his lifetime, there were many experiments and tests on Kytun to determine whether or not he was a prophet, god, or something else entirely. This ended up proving nothing but driving him insane. Kytun no longer cared what he was, but he did wish to cause snakes a fraction of the pain he felt. His powers of gold wreaked havoc on the existing social order. The ability to create gold made the rulers no wealthier than a peasant. And gold itself held no value more than a rock, perhaps less!\n\nIn contemporary times, people tend to forget about Kytun. When talked about, his powers leave many confused. Some even claim that instead of being blessed by #G Sserstryss#! naturally, perhaps he comes from a mixed group, inherenting divine powers from elsewhere. Some do, however, point to the theme of greed that both come from wealth, and well represents Kytun's life, ruined from the greed of others."

deity_banas:0 "$omen_banas$"
omen_banas:0 "Banash"
omen_banas_desc:0 "Banash, sometimes called the lady of luck, was a prophet from around 2,000 years ago. Her time period was filled with a certain crisis that has been lost to time. It is said that she not gifted in any skills, yet somehow would stumble into the right place at the right time, and somehow say the right things as well. Eventually, people realized she must be a prophet of #G Sserstryss#! based around luck.\n\nThe discovery of her prophethood was a controversial one. She was not a popular figure do to her clumsiness, even in spite of her impressive achievements. This resulted in a war against her... which she luckily won, all but proving her divine nature. The reason why this was so detested at the time was that it implied that #G Sserstryss#! was lucky, that his greatness was not at all unapposed. The concept of #Y World-Serpents#! being imperfect creatures is now a commonly accepted truth of #E Velkopic#!."

deity_euryal:0 "$omen_euryal$"
omen_euryal:0 "Euryal"
omen_euryal_desc:0 "Euryal is sometimes called the #Y Last Prophet#!, although such rhetoric is looked down upon outside of the #T Euryalean League#!. Like his name would imply, Euryal is the founder of the league and the first person to make a true kingdom. It started out via diplomacy, uniting the disparate tribes of island of the #E Agreer#! mountain, before it formalized into something of a centralized realm.\n\nEuryal is responsible for the standardization of #E Snaketongue#!, the script of the majority of #E Ular-Prians#!. His genius was eventually considerred proof of his relation and blessing from #G Sserstryss#!, elevating his level to that of a prophet."

deity_loione:0 "$omen_loione$"
omen_loione:0 "Lolo"
omen_loione_desc:0 "Lolo, the goddess of life as she was once known, played a pivotal role in the survival of serpentkind. According to snake folklore, one of the reasons the #Y World-Serpents#! all died out was their inability to reproduce. Some think it was a curse set upon them, others think it was always the case. Regardless, after #G Sserstryss#! died and gave rise to serpentkind, this inability was broken by Lolo. She was the only snake able to produce eggs. Thus, all future generations of serpents are directly related to her.\n\nDuring her reinterpretation as a prophet by #R Zyalassr#!, many theories arose about the nature of reproduction. #G Sserstryss#! was able to give rise to a new species, and in many ways, that is a form of reproduction. This has lead some to theorize that perhaps #G Sserstryss#! was either both a female and male or neither female nor male. Relating more directly to Lolo, some theorize she was the first female snake to ever live, explaining why the #Y World-Serpents#! and most of the first generation of serpents could not carry eggs."

deity_zyalassr:0 "$omen_zyalassr$"
omen_zyalassr:0 "Zyalassr"
omen_zyalassr_desc:0 "Zyalassr is often called the #Y First Prophet#!. He was the first one blessed by #G Sserstryss#! to proclaim himself not a god, but a prophet. This would begin the reform of the #E Velkopic#! religion and reinterpretations of what previously were considerred deities.\n\nZyalassr's message was a simple one; #G Sserstryss#! is the ancestral #Y World-Serpent#! to all of snake kind left today. Everyone after the death of #G Sserstryss#! is no god, but simply a prophet chosen by the power of #G Sserstryss#! himself. Many found Zyalassr crazy at the time, even if he did have divine powers, to claim all other beings with those powers including himself are but an extention of the #Y World-Serpent#! was an insane claim. His teachings, however, were soon put into practice, and much of serpentkind would notice the benefits. Thus, Zyalassr's cult became the defacto religion of all snakes, vipers, and serpents."

deity_vensyn:0 "$omen_vensyn$"
omen_vensyn:0 "Vensyn"
omen_vensyn_desc:0 "Vensyn, the once god of venom. Vensyn had the ability to both cure and destroy, but he was far more famous for his destructive powers. While snakekind often has existed in peace, the rule of Vensyn certainly wasn't one of them.\n\nLater, Vensyn was identified as a prophet representing an interesting divine concept. If one has the power to help, should they help? The answer to snakekind is clear; no. Vensyn was a large sticking point in the times of #R Zyalassr#!. Many questions how he could be considerred a prophet? That word was associated with humans and their so called holier ways. However, the idea of a prophet itself was turned on its head, and thus, Vensyn was from thenforth a prophet."

deity_sxossathar:0 "$omen_sxossathar$"
omen_sxossathar:0 "Sxossathar"
omen_sxossathar_desc:0 "Sxossathar is a prophet from 4,000 years ago. He comes well after #R Zyalassr#!, and was famous for his powers of creation. Sxossathar interpreted his powers as a version of #G Sserstryss#!'s divine power that allowed him to create the very land all serpents live on.\n\nSxossathar's powers of creation would end up to be his doom. It would give him a certain sense of vanity, for the power of creation was not only something connected to #G Sserstryss#!, but something exclusive to a few gods even amongst the human pantheons. So, he attempted to build a tower to the heavens, to show all the power of snakekind... but early in construction, the tower fell, killing him."

deity_taana:0 "$omen_taana$"
omen_taana:0 "Tanna"
omen_taana_desc:0 "Tanna is semi-mythical, her story stretches back as far as #G Sserstryss#! himself. Despite being unable to bear eggs, Tanna and #G Sserstryss#! were mates. There is sparse record of that time so long ago, any impact of the #Y World-Serpents#! is difficult to discern. One local legend claims that Tanna and #G Sserstryss#! were both on the verge of death. To avoid seeing each other die, one left for the west and the other towards the east. Perhaps another society of serpentkind exists in a far away place, then. We may never truly know."

deity_solagi:0 "$omen_solagi$"
omen_solagi:0 "Solagi"
omen_solagi_desc:0 "Solagi was once known as the god of winds. Able to summon storms, lightning, but also warm winds and good rains. In the ancient times, he was worshipped by giving him sacrifices, and in death, it is said that an entire island's populace was sacrificed in mourning.\n\nIn contemporary times, Solagi has become recognizede as a prophet, representing the mercurial nature of the world. Perhaps even, Solagi represents the severe weather of the world before #G Sserstryss#! and the other #Y World-Serpents#!."

deity_anandeix:0 "$omen_anandeix$"
omen_anandeix:0 "Anandeix"
omen_anandeix_desc:0 "Anandeix was once a guardian spirit of the mundance households prior to her reclassification as a prophet during the Velkopic reforms, her percise domain being concerned with the notions of cunning warfare and staunch defenses. Sharing descent from the lordly kings of Old Mingadg prior to the unification of Ular-Pria, Anandeix possessed three other sisters who too were blessed with the notions of a provident life, said figures being the prophets Ishial, Saririyash, and Anegip. \n\nThe four went about conquering their neighbors during Many-States period of serpentkind, with Anandeix in particular having become reveared for her mystical abilities to soothe the ancient tigers of her homeland, commanding them as if they were fellow warriors beholden to her authority. As such, her many myths often conflate her personality with the aspects of a striking hunter and glorious leader, with tiger iconogrophy being ever present in those shrines dedicated to her name."

deity_ishial:0 "$omen_ishial$"
omen_ishial:0 "Ishial"
omen_ishial_desc:0 "Ishial was the second hatched sister of the divine clutch of Old Mingadg that included Anandeix, Saririyash, and Anegip, renowned for her ability to connect herself with the very souls of her own soldiers during her state's conquests of the fractured Ular-Pria. A mage of the highest caliber, Ishial was trained in not only the practical applications of magic but as well as those theoretical conducts that necessitate innovation. \n\nWithin her war camp where she was queen in all but name, Ishial spent much of her time devising new strategems that utilized experimental magic, of which included her young art of psionicism. While she could not teach others to replicate her form of magic, a distinction which led to her being dubbed a goddess posthumously by her countrymen, her soul proved strong enough as to be the sole conduit of her army's strength, linking them as one into a perfect war machine that knew no falter."

deity_saririyash:0 "$omen_saririyash$"
omen_saririyash:0 "Saririyash"
omen_saririyash_desc:0 "Saririyash, youngests of her provident brood that included the prophets Anandeix, Ishial, and Anegip, was a wild mage through and through, yet she chose to keep herself in touch with the people of the wider world, even for the most minor of things such as crop failure and loose livestock. \n\nPrior to the Zyalassr reforms she was seen a goddess of abundance and growth, an icon of maternal qualities concerned not only with the rearing of children but as well of crops and livestock. She was the sole beacon of love and mercy to those border peoples of old Mingadg, as well as those conquered folk who then swore themselves to her stewardship as to escape the wrath of her sisters. ."

deity_anegip:0 "$omen_anegip$"
omen_anegip:0 "Anegip"
omen_anegip_desc:0 "The most obscure of the late prophetesses that include Anandeix, Ishial, and Saririyash, Anegip was less concerned with those militaistic triviaities her sistsers preoccupied themselves with, and rather she strove to accumulate all the riches she could musters from the belongings of those foreigners who would bare both their minds and hearts to her lightning-like wit. \n\nPerhaps not a swinddler, for she sold honestly and without much glamour, Anegip traveled far and wide even across countries that were at war with her homeland of Old Mingadg, a testament to her resounding charm, of which the commoners belived to have been due to her education as a royal mage with unique powers besides her sisters. In fact it was this ability of her's that saved her nation from total destruction once their enemies united against, and with her wealth she was able to take take command over the ruling dynasty from the shadows, with her efforts eventually seeing her country to once more propser."

deity_cunren:0 "$omen_cunren$"
omen_cunren:0 "Akunran"
omen_cunren_desc:0 "The patron goddess of herbalists and farmers, Akunran was a god of the bark and leaves back before the sundering of Omniluxia and Ular-Pria's sinking. They championed construction of great cities and even greater temples dedicated to his name, having heard the plight of those impovrished serpents of the age and chose to elevate on par with the likes of other states. \n\nEventually, he too would have to face the realization of death and decay, for when the time came he would choose to incase himself within molten gold in the now sunken city of Akarautung, where it is said that his corpse still resides in today, a shining beacon in the underwater depths."
