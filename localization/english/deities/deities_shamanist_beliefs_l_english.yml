omen_sserstryss_desc:0 "It is said long ago, #Y World-serpents#! roamed the land, however, they were neither immortal nor able to reproduce. Overtime, the #Y World-serpents #!dwindled, but one remained; Sserstryss. From this #Y World-serpent's#! corpse eventually formed the #E Austropetolian Archipelago#!. Its blood became the water, splitting landmasses from each other. Its eyes became the two mountains of #E Etrorg and Agreer#!. And from its skin spawned a miracle, the #E Ular-Pria#!.\n\nIn ancient snake times, there existed a pantheon, beings who held divine-like power. However, over time, these 'gods' became more like prophets, one of which was named #R Zyalassr#!. He would explain that the gods are not truly gods, but like him, chosen snakes to lead snakekind in the name of Sserstryss. While the cult of #R Zyalassr#! was originally quite small, as more and more 'prophets' repeated his message, it was canonized, and Ssertryss became the only deity within the #T Velkopic#! pantheon."

omen_euryal_desc:0 "Euryal is sometimes called the #Y Last Prophet#!, although such rhetoric is looked down upon outside of the #T Euryalean League#!. Like his name would imply, Euryal is the founder of the league and the first person to make a true kingdom. It started out via diplomacy, uniting the disparate tribes of island of the #E Agreer#! mountain, before it formalized into something of a centralized realm.\n\nEuryal is responsible for the standardization of #E Snaketongue#!, the script of the majority of #E Ular-Prians#!. His genius was eventually considerred proof of his relation and blessing from #G Sserstryss#!, elevating his level to that of a prophet."

omen_zyalassr:0 "Zyalassr"
omen_zyalassr_desc:0 "Zyalassr is often called the #Y First Prophet#!. He was the first one blessed by #G Sserstryss#! to proclaim himself not a god, but a prophet. This would begin the reform of the #E Velkopic#! religion and reinterpretations of what previously were considerred deities.\n\nZyalassr's message was a simple one; #G Sserstryss#! is the ancestral #Y World-serpent#! to all of snake kind left today. Everyone after the death of #G Sserstryss#! is no god, but simply a prophet chosen by the power of #G Sserstryss#! himself. Many found Zyalassr crazy at the time, even if he did have divine powers, to claim all other beings with those powers including himself are but an extention of the #Y World-serpent#! was an insane claim. His teachings, however, were soon put into practice, and much of serpentkind would notice the benefits. Thus, Zyalassr's cult became the defacto religion of all snakes, vipers, and serpents."
