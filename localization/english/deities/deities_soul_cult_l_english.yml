 omen_grom:0 "Grom"
 omen_grom_desc:0 "One of the gods given rise to by #G Wielkopan#!, Grom is a beast-like deity who feeds upon to warring energy of mortals. His worship began during wartime as it was said that if Grom was fed often enough, he would bestow great gifts of war to ease the suffering it caused mortals. However, worship of Grom is also shunned in parts of the peninsula seeing as it causes an uptick in aggressive diplomacy."

 omen_wielkopan:0 "Wielkopan"
 omen_wielkopan_desc:0 "One of the #Y Post-Primordial Gods#!, Wielkopan is said to have been the first to bless Southeastern part of Luxterra. He is considerred related to the four great gods of Omniluxia, including the much more widespread #G Wishtheon#!, the distant #G Artheous#!, and the lost fourth god rumored to live in the distant east."
 
 deity_neiya:0 "$omen_neiya$"
 omen_neiya:0 "Neiya"
 omen_neiya_desc:0 "A goddess of death, Neiya is said to have been created around the same time as the #G Zerywan#! were, but by different origin. Neiya was created directly by #G Wielkopan#! and thus had much more prominence in the past. Her duties are far from antiquated, however, as she still keeps a large following, especially in areas where the #Y Three Brothers#! were not granted."
 
 deity_rossovi:0 "$omen_rossovi$"
 omen_rossovi:0 "Rossovi"
 omen_rossovi_desc:0 "The #Y Brother of the South#!, Rossovi is the wild brother of the three. Unlike his other two brothers, Rossovi was said to have taken the blessing from #G Zerywan#! by force and trickery. Thus, he was expelled and launched his migration to the south establishing a new people, the Rossovie. He did not contact the other two brothers after his migration, yet even with this isolation, the people of Rossovie were successful and the worship of Rossovi persists to this day."
 
 deity_zehi:0 "$omen_zehi$"
 omen_zehi:0 "Zehi"
 omen_zehi_desc:0 "#Y The brother of the North#!, Zehi is the harmonic brother of the three. Said to have been blessed by the #G Zerywan#! themselves, Zehi was given the lands north of #T Jelen Mountain#!. Zehi's folly was that of peace. He believed in harmony and distilled this amongst his people, but they could not help him against the western invaders. He did, however, get help from #G Lechi#! to retain the remaining parts of his people's lands. It is said that the Zehian people are destined to reclaim what was lost in the west."
 
 deity_jelenia_soul:0 "$omen_jelenia_soul$"
 omen_jelenia_soul:0 "Jelenia's Truth"
 omen_jelenia_soul_desc:0 "#E The following is a transcription and translation of the Great Soul Devourer's words to his followers#!\n"Hear me, those who believe in the truth. Those fools in #E Starogod#! believe they follow in the winds of #E Jelen#!, yet they understand not why she blows her winds west. To find ourselves in the Elixir capital of Novkar, it is no coincidence, but simply fate. #E Jelenia#! has spoken to me, the first who consumed the soulgems, and she spoke clearly. All must fall, a new society must be built, the secret of the #Y Soulgems#! is far darker than those elitist in #E Starogod#! will admit. Soulgems #R contain the souls of the dead#!. By consuming the soulgems, we free them, allow them to live on within us. Free the souls from the infidels!""
 
 deity_zerywan:0 "$omen_zerywan$"
 omen_zerywan:0 "Zerywan"
 omen_zerywan_desc:0 "The most important deity of the Zerywani people, the Zerywan are the twin deities, brothers that come from the womb of the primordial goddess of earth herself. Zerywan's reverence superceded that of other local deities because unlike the #Y Four Great Gods#! of Omniluxia or the #Y Primordial Gods#!, Zerywan would personally live amongst people for a time. Eventually, Zerywan would bless individual people or societies who revered them most, however, after the incident of the #Y Three Brothers#!, Zerywan took a more reserved and less direct role in mortal affairs. Still, his impact is said to be felt strongly throughout the peninsula."
 
 deity_lechi:0 "$omen_lechi$"
 omen_lechi:0 "Lechi"
 omen_lechi_desc:0 "The #Y Brother of the East#!, Lechi is the warlike brother of the three. Said to have been blessed by the #G Zerywan#! themselves, Lechi was given the lands east of #T Jelen Mountain#!. It is there where he gave rise to the Lechian people who constantly fight amongst themselves. It is said that Lechi was the most hotheaded of the brothers, and that #G Zehi#! had to often intervene in order to save Lechi from self-annihilation."
