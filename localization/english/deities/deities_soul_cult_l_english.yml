 omen_consume_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Edicts I#!\nA priest preaches, "The consumption of souls is the most famous piece of our beliefs, brothers and sisters. To consume a soulgem is to consume a soul itself. Many outsiders will wonder why we would want to consume a soul. Simply take one elixir, brewed from a soulgem, and taste it yourself. The freedom it gives you and the soul trapped within stone is unlike any other. Rise, followers of Rzezimir, and take a sip of liberty.""

 omen_wielkopan_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Histories I#!\nZenna the reborn reveals, "In ancient times, before even the times of the #G Zerywan#!, we were lead astray. Many claim that #G Wielkopan#! simply left us, however, this is far from the truth. He sealed his soul into the mountain, into the walls of #E Starogod#!. This, we know now, was a test. A test we have been failing for a long time. It is time to free the soul fo #G Wielkopan#! himself by devouring every last bit of the soulgems that capture his essence.""

 omen_neiya_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Edicts II#!\nRzezimir exclaims,"We all will perish one day. And when we do, our souls will become free. However, some of our soul will become trapped within stones. Our very essence leaks without a physical body. It is then we will be freed one day by one of us, my brothers and sisters. One of the soul devourers will release the rest of you from the earth which buries you. This is an important part of the soul devourer's mission.""

 omen_zehi_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Histories III#!\nA soul priest explains, "The prophet, Zenna, she is the reincarnation of #G Zehi#! himself! She revealed herself in a dream after the first consumption of souls by #G Rzezimir#!, explaining to him that she will reappear in the real world when the soul devourers rise from their hiding places, and she will take his hand in marriage to lead the Soul Devourer's nation from #T Old Zechie#!.""

 omen_jelenia_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Edicts III#!\nRzezimir shouts, "Hear me, those who believe in the truth. Those fools in #E Starogod#! believe they follow in the winds of #E Jelen#!, yet they understand not why she blows her winds west. To find ourselves in the Elixir capital of #E Novkar#!, it is no coincidence, but simply fate. #E Jelenia#! has spoken to me, the first who consumed the soulgems, and she spoke clearly. All must fall, a new society must be built, the secret of the #Y Soulgems#! is far darker than those elitist in #E Starogod#! will admit. Soulgems #R contain the souls of the dead#!. By consuming the soulgems, we free them, allow them to live on within us. Free the souls from the infidels!""

 omen_zerywan_soul:0 "Lies of Zerywan"
 omen_zerywan_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Histories II#!\nA soul priest recounts, "The most shocking historical revelation that the soul devourer's reveal to you is the lie that is #G Zerywan#!. It is said that they came from the primordial earth mother, became popular through their charisma, and eventually blessed the three brothers of the #E Zerywanic#! faith. All of these are LIES! The painful truth is that the #G Zerywan#! tricked us mortals into believing #G Wielkopan#! was not aas great as they and their mother; a form of revenge on #G Wielkopan#! for replacing the earthen mother's place in the hearts of man. Then, when #G Wielkopan#! was sealed away, the #G Zerywan#! left, leaving only three poor brothers in their place, dooming them to eternal suffering. Our own #G Zechi#! was given land that was surely one day going to be conquered... and the #G Zerywan#! knew this from the start. He is also the reason why the three brothers were split in the first place, so that no one could ever again rival the earthen mother #G Zerywan#! kneels to.""

 omen_lesmian_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Edicts IV#!\nThe soul releaser tells us, "Among our many emergent traditions, the #G Lesmian Oracles#! have found a certain place in the souls of us devourers. Their account of history matches up much better with what we have been revealed than that of the fools in #E Starogod#!. They also allow us to connect further with the truths of the world by explaining our futures. Furthermore, souls act differently than our own, they do not get trapped in these soulgems, and thus, they can undergo more dangerous procedures to extract great revelations. For even if they perish, their souls will never be trapped like ours do.""

 omen_sacrifice_soul_desc:0 "#Y Soul Devourer's Histories IV#!\nThe historian of spirit teaches, "Our great and first leader, Rzezimir, is the chosen of #G Zenna, the Reborn#!. He was the first to experiment with the consumption of soulgems. He was the teacher and mentor to many of us once outcasts of society. He leads the world, whether this world, the next, or even the previous one. And he will bring an end of to the tyranny of lies that the #G Zerywan#! and the #G Earth Mother#! put in this world. Long live Rzezimir!""
