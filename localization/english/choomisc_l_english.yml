 ZANNI_LORE_DESCRIPTION: "The Zani Empire was once the mightiest nation in Omniluxia but is now shattered, a mere shadow of itself, divided and on the verge of destruction from all sides.\nWill it ever reunite or stay divided between two separate centers of legislative is a question that many claimants have sought to answer, and yet none have thus far managed to reforge the Broken Empire."

 LUXTERRICHE_LORE_DESCRIPTION: "Werhenland was located in centre of Omniluxia when it was one continent, and long did the Werhenlanders struggle against the encroachments of the Zani Empire. Most of Werhenlandish nations converted to the Helluvian faith, and the proud Knights that rule over their society were quick to harness the religious strife within their lands in order to wage wars of aggression against the heretics."


 HIGH_ELVEN_LORE_DESCRIPTION: "High Elven nations mastered the ocean and sent their colonists around Omniluxia, where a large portion of them settled on Arteon, waging war against the human kingdoms and enslaving their population. Elven domination is seen by independent nations of the isle as an existential threat, but they are seemingly unable to place aside their personal squabbles in order to repel the invaders. Undeterred by any resistance they have encountered, High Elves send various expeditions around Omniluxian continents to seek more land and power."

 FOREST_ELVEN_LORE_DESCRIPTION: "Long, long ago, Wood Elves were present in every corner of Omniluxia, but the expansion of human nations pushed them deeper into the woods that birthed them. As a culture, they find themselves in dire straights, for their forests are dying and their vicious neighbors are threatening to invade their homes. Although waging war is anathema to their spiritual beliefs, they are finding themselves more and more involved in the affairs of humankind, oftentimes being forced to fight for their very survival."

 COMMON_DWARVEN_LORE_DESCRIPTION: "In various regions of Omniluxia, one can encounter the Common Dwarves, who originally hailed from the Skyreach Mountains but can now be found all across the world. Common Dwarves are masterful miners and architects, but chose to live on the surface of Omniluxia instead of deep underground, like their cousins the Silver Dwarves. Once, it was said that the Dwarves ruled over one-fifth of Luxterra, but hordes of Old Dragkhans and Elves shattered the Dwarven Empire and scattered their communities; ever since then, the Dwarves have contented themselves with what they have."

 DUNYDURCEG_LORE_DESCRIPTION: "Dunydurceg were once the proud inhabitants living on the Great Steppes, content to live their simple lives under the stars until political meddling by the Zani Emperor forced their wrath upon the civilized lands. Heeding the call to war, their migration was the greatest disaster that the Zani Empire ever faced; caught unawares by the roving nomads, the Zani lost a third of their empire in the initial invasion and almost saw their capital city fall to the invaders. One of the last accomplishments of the fading Zani state was the campaign that saved them from the Dunydurceg Horde, but they were unable to destroy the tribes, who proceeded to sack the rest of the Empire before permanently settling in the south."
