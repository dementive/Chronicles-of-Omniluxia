 ######RELIGIONS######
 the_first_emperor: "Zanisite"
 desc_the_first_emperor: "The Imperial Pantheon of Zanis, the first Emperor of the Zani, persists in the Zani peoples who descend from him. Zanis continues to protect his people as a half-god, and the Zanisite Faith focuses upon honoring the memory and achievements of the greatest Zani Emperor with a series of rituals that ensures his divine presence remains within the land."

 the_old_pantheon: "Elemenic"
 desc_the_old_pantheon: "The Elemenic Faith is one of the most ancient forms of worship within Omniluxia, based on the rapturous experience of emotion in all of its forms. Happiness and sadness, joy and despair, love and hatred, war and peace - the duality of human emotional experience is viewed to flow from the same unified divine source, with all things being preordained from the beginning of time."

 beatepian_pantheon: "Baetepian"
 desc_beatepian_pantheon: "The history of the indigenous Baetep religion stretches back many thousands of years and is defined by the rituals that the priestly caste faithfully uphold. Manifesting as a polytheistic faith, the worship of Sutet, Atepr, Sunet and others displays a deep reverence for the fundamental aspects of the natural world."

 great_wolf_pantheon: "Lupinite"
 desc_great_wolf_pantheon: "The pantheon of Lula, the Lone Wolf God and his many reincarnations throughout time, Lupinite is an ancient religion that was once widespread throughout Omniluxia, but now remains at the edge of Weagelia near where Lula is said to reside."

 victory_pantheon: "Viktreic"
 desc_victory_pantheon: "This pantheon praises the goddess of Victory, who gains her powers when successful conquests are consecrated to her; the more kingdoms that fall before her holy symbols, the stronger her omens become." 

 helluvian: "Helluvian"
 desc_helluvian: "The Helluvian Pantheon claims to serve the one true god, the Creator of All Things That Can Never Be Known. For thousands of years, the Helluvian Faith flourished, yet the greatest crisis the Church ever faced was the Zainuddian Heresy preached by the Two Prophets that splintered the ranks of the faithful and ultimately formed a new religion. Battered from the religious wars yet still standing, the Helluvians still harbor dreams of destroying the Zainuddians." 

 zainuddian: "Zainuddian"
 desc_zainuddian: "Originally viewed as a heresy of the Helluvian Church, the tenets of the Zainuddian Faith was revealed to two prophets, Jaoz the Bold and Bachin, Lord of Dui-Pattar, who abandoned their former lives of opulence and wealth in the northern cities to preach the imminent arrival of the true god to the tribes of the Zinduidians. None could foresee the devastation that this divine message would bring, however, and as the new faith spread through the southern lands of Luxterra like wildfire, there were many religious wars that were waged against the Zainuddians in hopes of stamping out their beliefs. The Zainuddians overcame their enemies, however, and now their religion thrives, with the faithful awaiting the promised Apocalypse that will free them from this mortal coil." 

 yedidyhan: "Yedidyhan"
 desc_yedidyhan: "Although many Helluvian religious scholars would deny this, the Yedidyhan Pantheon claims to be the earliest form of Helluvian worship and thus call themselves the 'Old Believers' in order to differentiate themselves from those around them. No one can deny that Yedidyhan is one of the oldest religions in Omniluxia, and the faith is practiced by seven large tribes that are scattered around the world."  

 blood_tainted_pantheon: "Blood-Stained"
 desc_blood_tainted_pantheon: "The religious movement that calls itself 'Blood-Stained' is a twisted off-shot of the Elemenic Faith, but instead of embracing all aspects of emotional experience, the followers of this heretical sect focus only upon the joys of misery; murder, violence, deceit and destruction are the prerogatives of the Blood-Stained, who have given themselves over to the darkness." 

 zerywan_pantheon: "Zerywanic"
 desc_zerywan_pantheon: "The Zerywanic Faith comprises the traditional belief system of the ancient tribes that once conquered all across Luxterra before settling in the southern plains, and as such, contains many precepts and notions that were taken from the subjugated peoples that lived under the yoke of the Zerywani Horde." 

 father_protector_pantheon: "Patreic"
 desc_father_protector_pantheon: "Patreic religious beliefs borrow heavily from the Celtican manner of worship, but they are not as community-oriented as their traditionalist neighbors, which value the family over the individual; the Patreics have borrowed many of the Orcanite mantras that preach the worthiness of the Self, and there are even some Helluvian influences at olay. Patreic beliefs have been favorably compared to a cosmopolitan version of the Celtican Faith; they learn from those around them, adopting and growing to meet the challenges of the day." 

 dragkhan_pantheon: "Drakhanic"
 desc_dragkhan_pantheon: "The Drakhanic religion is the worship of the self, where one's own desires and wants are the only thing in the universe that matters. Rewards are given only to those who will take them and nothing is assured in this life except for one's own death; a dark philosophy that has many nihilistic connotations for the Drakhanic faithful. Drakhanic gods are creatures of cruelty and despair, leading armies of misery against the armies of good."  

 artheous_pantheon: "Artheousan"
 desc_artheous_pantheon: "When the world was young and the gods of Omniluxia struggled to contain the threat of the Dragons from destroying everything, there was a giant wyrm, a timeless beast of darkness named Arteon, who was slain by the legendary human hero Artheousan. As the dragon lay dying, its breath and blood coalesced into the form of a beautiful woman; a bride for the mighty Artheousan, and the mother of the first Arteonians. The Artheousan Faith honors the tradition of this first hero and founder of nations."  

 celtican_pantheon: "Celtican"
 desc_celtican_pantheon: "The Celtican Faith comprises the traditional belief systems of the Celtican people, who value simplicity in thinking, hard work and good, upstanding moral character. Celtican beliefs are centered around the home and the hearth, with many families leading their own religious ceremonies. This is not a centralized religion, but one where the people are expected to manage their spiritual state themselves - a notion that is squarely Celtican and reflects their pragmatic values."  

 shamanist_beliefs: "Velkopic"
 desc_shamanist_beliefs: "Velkopic is the name of the belief system embraced the snakefolk. The Velkopic pantheon is filled with fierce war deities that promise victory against one's enemies and crave the blood of innocent souls. Many fear the violence and savagery of the Velkopic faith, for even children are set before the flames in their Temples - their gods demand everything."   

 mother_earth_pantheon: "Aneic"
 desc_mother_earth_pantheon: "Aneic is what the Wood Elves call their faith, claiming that it is the name of goddess that planted the first tree within the World's Lungs Forest, their ancient homeland. A simple and peace-loving religion that teaches the Oneness of Nature and encourages time outdoors, where communion is held under the canopy of the forest instead of the marble halls of the Temple, true Aneic believers abhor war and only begrudingly fight their enemies."  

 orcish_ancestral_faith: "Orcanite"
 desc_orcish_ancestral_faith: "The precepts of the Orcanite Faith are focused upon finding and nurturing one's Inner Flame, the divine spark that some other religions refer to as the 'soul'. An Orcanite adherent's relationship with their own Inner Flame changes and matures throughout life, and although most are content to let their lights naturally dim when it is time to pass into the next world, there are heretical Orcanite sects that magically lengthen their lifespan through utilizing the dark arts known as the 'Black Flame'."   

 the_old_father_stone: "Hebric"
 desc_the_old_father_stone: "Hebric is the name of the religion that most dwarves follow, and although there are some humans that have converted to their ways, it remains mostly a dwarven phenomenon. The Hebric Pantheon is filled with ancient dwarf-heroes of yore that ascended into godhood via their virtuous and mighty deeds; a promise to every dwarf that they, too, can hope to become like the gods themselves. " 

 transcendence_enlighten: "Ascendic"
 desc_transcendence_enlighten: "Ascendic is the religion of the High Elves, a name that is as much of a promise as it is a threat. The High Elves view their culture to be superior over every others, and this includes spiritual matters as well; the adherents of the Ascendic Faith believe that their hour is at hand, and that soon they shall smash the false pantheons of the unbelievers - Ascendic supremacy is an inevitability."  

 vetalian_pantheon: "Vetalian"
 desc_vetalian_pantheon: "The Vetalian beliefs are very old indeed, and those that worship the Vetalian gods cling to their pantheon with a fervor that belies the people's love for their traditional deities. Throughout different periods of her history, Vetalian beliefs have been suppressed by the invading armies, and it was only the faith of the people that kept their spirits high during the dark days of slavery. The Vetalians Faith preaches the universality and inevitability of suffering, but promises that there is an end to the misery that we must endure."   

 seekers_beliefs: "Seekers Beliefs"
 desc_seekers_beliefs: "The Seekers are a religious cult that preaches the dissolution of one's ego, where one must renounce their identity and self in order to truly be free, for it is only when we have abandoned the chains of our past that we are able to Seek the Way. Their prophets and wise men agree that all that matters is the 'Seeking', although what exactly is being sought after is not told to non-believers. Akin to something like a secret society, Seekers have managed to seize control of entire kingdoms, turning the resources of their captive nations to furthering the Way." 

 ancestral_beliefs: "Karric"
 desc_ancestral_beliefs: "Karric belief refers to ancestor worship, and although there are religious differences between various cultures of Omniluxia that practice the Karric Faith, they are similar enough to be recognized as originating from the same source. Karric adherents value the memory of their forebears and try to be mindful of their own influences on the generations to come."  

 fallen_star_pantheon: "Stellaic"
 desc_fallen_star_pantheon: "The Stellaic Faith literally worships wealth, claiming it to be a visible sign of the blessing of the gods. Stellaic Ministers all but rule the Merchant Republics of the Errnorfallians, and the prime motivation of these nations remains on the making of money." 

 ####NEW RELIGIONS##### 
 arame_pantheon: "Aramic"
 desc_arame_pantheon: "Although the Aramic and Hortenic religions are both found in desolate regions in the far north, that is the only similarity that they share. Aramic is a religion of peace and forgiveness; the world is a cold, cruel place, and it is in the interest of humanity to take care of their brethren, for life is hard enough as it is. While not everyone within the ranks of the Aramic faithful can live up to their own lofty expectations, they certainly try their hardest. "

 polari_pantheon: "Polaric"
 desc_polari_pantheon: "The Polaric faith shares many of its philosophies with the Aramic religion, yet Polaric has an outlook on life that is not as idealistic as Aramic is. The Polaric Faith teaches that one should do their best to help others, but argues that the world is slowly corrupting into a state where nothing will be able to save it, not even the interventions of the Polaric faithful, and that when this happens, the end is almost near. The Great Collapse is seen by the Polarics to be the first sign of this impending Apocalypse."

 werhenic_pantheon: "Werfudrian"
 desc_werhenic_pantheon: "The Werfudrian Faith is a belief system that is tempered by philosophy, with the good stewardship of the nation-state being the ultimate form of worship and a sign of true religious devotion. While not as exciting as other faiths - Werfudrian has been drily described as a librarian's religion, suitable only for bookworms and bores - the followers of this simple way of life often live happy and productive lives."

 eptelon_pantheon: "Eptelenic"
 desc_eptelon_pantheon: "The Eptelenic religion does not preach a universal truth or promise salvation to the entire world; it is only concerned with the island of Eptelon and its inhabitants. Because of its insular nature, many foreigners have completely ignored the Eptelenic religion, and perhaps with good reason, but the Eptelenic faithful see no reason to abandon the gods that protect their sacred island."

 mother_warrior_pantheon: "Madreic"
 desc_mother_warrior_pantheon: "Those who call themselves Madreic have surrendered their lives to the worship of the Mother Warrior and will spend the rest of their days fighting to serve the divine will. A religion of strength and glory, Madreic is often favored by those that join military orders, and many Knights secretly carry the sign of the Mother Warrior against their chests."

 light_religion: "Luminist"
 desc_light_religion: "The Luminist Faith is a religion of light, of purity, of the overwhelming brightness of Truth in a world polluted by Lies and Darkness. The Light that the Luminists worship is a purifying fire that burns away the scales covering the eyes of the unbelievers, allowing them to stare into the Universal Light."

 kinone_pantheon: "Kino"
 desc_kinone_pantheon: "The Kino religion is the traditional beliefs of the Kinones and reflects the generous and altruistic nature of its people. Kino religious texts speak out against the cruelty of serfdom and slavery, preaching that no man is better than any other, but that all are equal in the eyes of the gods."

 hortenic_pantheon: "Hortenic"
 desc_hortenic_pantheon: "The ancient faith of the Hortenic people is as grim and humorless as its inhabitants, and its sacred texts are mostly filled with fearsome imagery of never-ending blizzards, frozen hells with howling winds, and demons made of ice. It is no wonder that most of the Horteonians abandoned their traditional ways after they invaded the southern islands, although some back home still follow the old Hortenic rites."
