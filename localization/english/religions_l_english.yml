 ######RELIGIONS######
 the_first_emperor: "Zanisite"

 desc_the_first_emperor: "The Imperial Pantheon of Zanis, the first Emperor of the Zani, persists in the Zani peoples who descend from him. Zanis continues to protect his people as a half-god, and the Zanisite Faith focuses upon honoring the memory and achievements of the greatest Zani Emperor with a series of rituals that ensures his divine presence remains within the land."

 the_old_pantheon: "Elemenic"
 desc_the_old_pantheon: "The Elemenic Faith is one of the most ancient forms of worship within Omniluxia, based on the rapturous experience of emotion in all of its forms. Happiness and sadness, joy and despair, love and hatred, war and peace - the duality of human experience is viewed to flow from the same divine source, with all things being preordained from the beginning of time."

 beatepian_pantheon: "Baetepian"
 desc_beatepian_pantheon: "The history of the indigenous Baetep religion stretches back many thousands of years and is defined by the rituals that the priestly caste faithfully uphold. Manifesting as a polytheistic faith, the worship of Sutet, Atepr, Sunet and others displays a deep reverence for the fundamental aspects of the natural world."

 great_wolf_pantheon: "Lupinite"
 desc_great_wolf_pantheon: "The pantheon of Lula, the Lone Wolf God and his many reincarnations throughout time, Lupinite is an ancient religion that was once widespread throughout Omniluxia, but now remains at the edge of Weagelia near where Lula is said to reside."

 victory_pantheon: "Viktreic"
 desc_victory_pantheon: "This pantheon praises the goddess of Victory, who gains her powers when successful conquests are consecrated to her; the more kingdoms that fall before her holy symbols, the stronger her omens become." 

 helluvian: "Helluvian"
 desc_helluvian: "The Helluvian Pantheon claims to serve the one true god, the Creator of All Things That Can Never Be Known. For thousands of years, the Helluvian Faith flourished, yet the greatest crisis the Church ever faced was the Zainuddian Heresy preached by the Two Prophets that splintered the ranks of the faithful and ultimately formed a new religion. Battered from the religious wars yet still standing, the Helluvians still harbor dreams of destroying the Zainuddians." 

 zainuddian: "Zainuddian"
 desc_zainuddian: "Originally viewed as a heresy of the Helluvian Church, the tenets of the Zainuddian Faith was revealed to two prophets, Jaoz the Bold and Bachin, Lord of Dui-Pattar, who abandoned their former lives of opulence and wealth in the northern cities to preach the imminent arrival of the true god to the tribes of the Zinduidians. None could foresee the devastation that this divine message would bring, however, and as the new faith spread through the southern lands of Luxterra like wildfire, there were many religious wars that were waged against the Zainuddians in hopes of stamping out their beliefs. The Zainuddians overcame their enemies, however, and now their religion thrives, with the faithful awaiting the promised Apocalypse that will free them from this mortal coil." 

 yedidyhan: "Yedidyhan"
 desc_yedidyhan: "Although many Helluvian religious scholars would deny this, the Yedidyhan Pantheon claims to be the earliest form of Helluvian worship and thus call themselves the 'Old Believers' in order to differentiate themselves. No one can deny that Yedidyhan is one of the oldest religions in Omniluxia, and the  faith is practiced by seven tribes that are scattered around the world."
