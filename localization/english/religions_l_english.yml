 the_first_emperor: "Zanisite"
 desc_the_first_emperor: "The Imperial Pantheon of Zanis, the first Emperor of the Zani, persists in the Zani peoples who descend from him. Zanis continues to protect his people as a half-god, and the Zanisite Faith focuses upon honoring the memory and achievements of the greatest Zani Emperor with a series of rituals that ensures his divine presence remains within the land."

 the_old_pantheon: "Elemenic"
 desc_the_old_pantheon: "The Elemenic Faith is one of the most ancient forms of worship within Omniluxia, based on the rapturous experience of emotion in all of its forms. Happiness and sadness, joy and despair, love and hatred, war and peace - the duality of human emotional experience is viewed to flow from the same unified divine source, with all things being preordained from the beginning of time."

 beatepian_pantheon: "Baetepian"
 desc_beatepian_pantheon: "The history of the indigenous Baetep religion stretches back many thousands of years and is defined by the rituals that the priestly caste faithfully uphold. Manifesting as a polytheistic faith, the worship of Sutet, Atepr, Sunet and others displays a deep reverence for the fundamental aspects of the natural world."

 great_wolf_pantheon: "Lupinite"
 desc_great_wolf_pantheon: "The pantheon of Lula, the Great Wolf God and his many reincarnations throughout time, Lupinite is an ancient religion that was once widespread throughout Omniluxia, but now remains at the edge of Weagelia near where Lula is said to reside."

 victory_pantheon: "Viktreic"
 desc_victory_pantheon: "This pantheon praises the goddess of Victory, who gains her powers when successful conquests are consecrated to her; the more kingdoms that fall before her holy symbols, the stronger her omens become." 

 helluvian: "Helluvian"
 desc_helluvian: "The Helluvian Pantheon claims to serve the one true god, the Creator of All Things That Can Never Be Known. For thousands of years, the Helluvian Faith flourished, yet the greatest crisis the Church ever faced was the Zainudian Heresy preached by the Two Prophets that splintered the ranks of the faithful and ultimately formed a new religion. Battered from the religious wars yet still standing, the Helluvians still harbor dreams of destroying the Zainudians." 

 zainuddian: "Zainudian"
 desc_zainuddian: "Originally viewed as a heresy of the Helluvian Church, the tenets of the Zainudian Faith was revealed to two prophets, Jaoz the Bold and Bachin, Lord of Dui-Pattar, who abandoned their former lives of opulence and wealth in the northern cities to preach the imminent arrival of the true god to the tribes of the Zinduidians. None could foresee the devastation that this divine message would bring, however, and as the new faith spread through the southern lands of Luxterra like wildfire, there were many religious wars that were waged against the Zainudians in hopes of stamping out their beliefs. The Zainudians overcame their enemies, however, and now their religion thrives, with the faithful awaiting the promised Apocalypse that will free them from this mortal coil." 

 yedidyhan: "Yedidyhan"
 desc_yedidyhan: "Although many Helluvian religious scholars would deny this, the Yedidyhan Pantheon claims to be the earliest form of Helluvian worship and thus call themselves the 'Old Believers' in order to differentiate themselves from those around them. No one can deny that Yedidyhan is one of the oldest religions in Omniluxia, and the faith is practiced by seven large tribes that are scattered around the world."  

 blood_tainted_pantheon: "Blood-Stained"
 desc_blood_tainted_pantheon: "The religious movement known to most as 'Blood-Stained' has recently been rapidly spreading across northeast Luxterra. It comes from the ways of the mysterious Drow that once resided deep in the mountains there. Recently, many Northlander and Norrfallian tribes have been embracing the dark ancient faith that the Drow have followed for centuries. It is similar in some ways to the ancient Elemenic faith, but instead of embracing all aspects of emotional experience, the followers focus only upon the joys of misery, murder, and violence. Deceit and destruction are the prerogatives of the Blood-Stained, who have given themselves over entirely to the darkness." 

 zerywan_pantheon: "Zerywanic"
 desc_zerywan_pantheon: "The Zerywanic Faith comprises the traditional belief system of the ancient tribes that once conquered all across Luxterra before settling in the southern plains, and as such, contains many precepts and notions that were taken from the subjugated peoples that lived under the yoke of the Zerywani Horde." 

 soul_cult:0 "Cult of the Soul"
 desc_soul_cult:0 "The Cult of the Soul is a cult which believes the consumption of soulgems is the only way to set the self free as well as the supposed souls trapped within the magic resource. Generally considered to be insane, with the lunacy being set off by the soulgems they consume, they are also often called the Soul Devourers."

 father_protector_pantheon: "Patreic"
 desc_father_protector_pantheon: "Patreic religious beliefs borrow heavily from the Celtican manner of worship, but they are not as community-oriented as their traditionalist neighbors, which value the family over the individual; the Patreics have borrowed many of the Orcanite mantras that preach the worthiness of the Self, and there are even some Helluvian influences at play. Patreic beliefs have been favorably compared to a cosmopolitan version of the Celtican Faith; they learn from those around them, adopting and growing to meet the challenges of the day." 

 dragkhan_pantheon: "Dragkhanic"
 desc_dragkhan_pantheon: "The Dragkhanic religion is the worship of the self, where one's own desires and wants are the only thing in the universe that matters. Rewards are given only to those who will take them and nothing is assured in this life except for one's own death; a dark philosophy that has many nihilistic connotations for the Dragkhanic faithful. Dragkhanic gods are creatures of cruelty and despair, leading armies of misery against the armies of good."  

 artheous_pantheon: "Artheousan"
 desc_artheous_pantheon: "When the world was young and the gods of Omniluxia struggled to contain the threat of the Dragons from destroying everything, there was a giant wyrm, a timeless beast of darkness named Arteon, who was slain by the legendary human hero Artheousan. As the dragon lay dying, its breath and blood coalesced into the form of a beautiful woman; a bride for the mighty Artheousan, and the mother of the first Arteonians. The Artheousan Faith honors the tradition of this first hero and founder of nations."  

 celtican_pantheon: "Celtican"
 desc_celtican_pantheon: "The Celtican Faith comprises the traditional belief systems of the Celtican people, who value simplicity in thinking, hard work and good, upstanding moral character. Celtican beliefs are centered around the home and the hearth, with many families leading their own religious ceremonies. This is not a centralized religion, but one where the people are expected to manage their spiritual state themselves - a notion that is squarely Celtican and reflects their pragmatic values."  

 shamanist_beliefs: "Velkopic"
 desc_shamanist_beliefs: "Velkopic, the religion of the snakefolk. Velkopic beliefs were once akin to that of a pantheon, however it now is filled with prophets all relating somehow to the last of the World-Serpents called Ssertryss. Many such prophets gain powers thanks to this link to Ssertryss, and they all represent well what it means to be a good serpent... unfortunately what makes a good serpent and what makes a good man are quite different."   

 mother_earth_pantheon: "Aneic"
 desc_mother_earth_pantheon: "Aneic represents the various beliefs of the Wood Elves, mainly centered around worship of the forest and Mother Earth, known to them as Cafea. Their gods are all Idrasil, or aspects of Mother Cafea, that preside over specific areas of everyday life.\n\nMost variations of this faith preach the Oneness of Nature and encourage followers to spend their time outdoors, where ceremonies are held under the canopy of the forest instead of the marble halls of the Temple. Aneids are traditionally pacifists that only fight defensive wars, however the large variety of beliefs across the Wood Elven tribes allows for certain cults to emphasize certain ideas and traditions."

 orcish_ancestral_faith: "Orcanite"
 desc_orcish_ancestral_faith: "The precepts of the Orcanite Faith are focused upon finding and nurturing one's Inner Flame, the divine spark that some other religions refer to as the 'soul'. An Orcanite adherent's relationship with their own Inner Flame changes and matures throughout life, and although most are content to let their lights naturally dim when it is time to pass into the next world, there are heretical Orcanite sects that magically lengthen their lifespan through utilizing the dark arts known as the 'Black Flame'."   

 the_old_father_stone: "Hebric"
 desc_the_old_father_stone: "The Hebric religion of the Copper Dwarves is the most widespread of the three denominations. They believe that Frei and Dwadais are the true heirs of the Stone Father, and their pantheon is filled with ancient dwarf-heroes of yore that ascended into godhood via their virtuous and mighty deeds; a promise to every dwarf that they, too, can hope to become like the gods themselves.\n\nProlific traders, their faith has been spread across Omniluxia, and although there are some humans that have converted to their ways, it remains mostly a dwarven faith." 

 the_old_father_silver: "Srrøhebrikk"
 desc_the_old_father_silver: "Srrøhebrikk is the Silver Dwarven variation of the Hebric religion. The main split between Srrøhebrikk and the other Hebric faiths is the worship of the Silver Dwarven pair, Hthgart and Ferja, as the true heirs of the Stone Father over the other two.\n\nThe most isolated and traditional of the three main groups, the Silver Dwarves have retained many customs and ideas that disappeared as the Gold and Copper dwarves interacted with the other races of Omniluxia. Aside from that, the faith also promotes grand building projects and the promise of godhood in the form of ancestor worship. Due to the majority of their gods being mythical Silver Dwarven heroes, there are few followers of the faith outside of the three main centers of Silver Dwarven civilization. However, interactions with neighboring peoples have led some to converting and venerating their own ancestors alongside dwarven ones." 

 the_old_father_gold: "Da Ash-Hêbriq"
 desc_the_old_father_gold: "Da Ash-Hêbriq is the Gold Dwarven interpretation of the Hebric faith. Followers worship the Gold Dwarven pair, Summsîr and Ava, as the true heirs of the Stone Father over the others. Aside from that, deities are Gold Dwarven heroes who have been laid to rest in the sacred Gold Caves alongside Summsîr and Ava, which means that few other races outside of the Gold Dwarves themselves adhere to the faith.\n\nThe Gold Dwarves also pride themselves in their crafts, with the most beautiful and unique creations considered the most prestigious. The most faithful often create beautiful golden idols to commemorate their gods." 

 kuulvaal: "Kuulvåal"
 desc_kuulvaal: "Kuulvåal, or the 'One Worship' is the monothestic religion of the Gnomes, who worship and revere only Wielkopan, or Wekuaa, over all other false gods. Believers also venerate various Taalvut, or angels, that help the common people in daily life.\n\nFinally, followers hope their devotion will be rewarded when a prophet emerges that will lead them back to their former homeland, a paradise known as Jaaltuvesk." 

 transcendence_enlighten: "Ascendic"
 desc_transcendence_enlighten: "Ascendic is the religion of the High Elves, a name that is as much of a promise as it is a threat. The High Elves view their culture to be superior over every others, and this includes spiritual matters as well; the adherents of the Ascendic Faith believe that their hour is at hand, and that soon they shall smash the false pantheons of the unbelievers - Ascendic supremacy is an inevitability."  

 vetalian_pantheon: "Vetalian"
 desc_vetalian_pantheon: "The Vetalian beliefs are very old indeed, and those that worship the Vetalian gods cling to their pantheon with a fervor that belies the people's love for their traditional deities. Throughout different periods of her history, Vetalian beliefs have been suppressed by the invading armies, and it was only the faith of the people that kept their spirits high during the dark days of slavery. The Vetalians Faith preaches the universality and inevitability of suffering, but promises that there is an end to the misery that we must endure."   

 seekers_beliefs: "Seekism"
 desc_seekers_beliefs: "The Seekers are a religious cult that preaches the dissolution of one's ego, where one must renounce their identity and self in order to truly be free, for it is only when we have abandoned the chains of our past that we are able to Seek the Way. Their prophets and wise men agree that all that matters is the 'Seeking', although what exactly is being sought after is not told to non-believers. While the Way remains supreme, they pray to various deities, believing them to be avatars of the Path. Akin to something like a secret society, Seekers have managed to seize control of entire kingdoms, turning the resources of their captive nations to furthering the Way." 

 ancestral_beliefs: "Karric"
 desc_ancestral_beliefs: "Karric belief refers to ancestor worship, and although there are religious differences between various cultures of Omniluxia that practice the Karric Faith, they are similar enough to be recognized as originating from the same source. Karric adherents value the memory of their forebears and try to be mindful of their own influences on the generations to come."  

 fallen_star_pantheon: "Stellaric"
 desc_fallen_star_pantheon:0 "The Stellaric faith is a fusion of 'the foreign' teachings coming from the mysterious eastern continent. The faith is filled with different philosophical beings with the ultimate goal being reaching the divine enlightment and becoming a star in the sky."
 #desc_fallen_star_pantheon: "The Stellaric Faith literally worships wealth, claiming it to be a visible sign of the blessing of the gods. Stellaric Ministers all but rule the Merchant Republics of the Errnorfallians, and the prime motivation of these nations remains on the making of money." 

 ####NEW RELIGIONS##### 
 arame_pantheon: "Aramic"
 desc_arame_pantheon: "Although the Aramic and Hortenic religions are both found in desolate regions in the far north, that is the only similarity that they share. Aramic is a religion of peace and forgiveness; the world is a cold, cruel place, and it is in the interest of humanity to take care of their brethren, for life is hard enough as it is. While not everyone within the ranks of the Aramic faithful can live up to their own lofty expectations, they certainly try their hardest. "

 polari_pantheon: "Polaric"
 desc_polari_pantheon: "The Polaric faith shares many of its philosophies with the Aramic religion, yet Polaric has an outlook on life that is not as idealistic as Aramic is. The Polaric Faith teaches that one should do their best to help others, but argues that the world is slowly corrupting into a state where nothing will be able to save it, not even the interventions of the Polaric faithful, and that when this happens, the end is almost near. The Great Collapse is seen by the Polarics to be the first sign of this impending Apocalypse."

 werhenic_pantheon: "Werfudrian"
 desc_werhenic_pantheon: "The Werfudrian Faith is a belief system that is tempered by philosophy, with the good stewardship of the nation-state being the ultimate form of worship and a sign of true religious devotion. While not as exciting as other faiths - Werfudrian has been drily described as a librarian's religion, suitable only for bookworms and bores - the followers of this simple way of life often live happy and productive lives."

 eptelon_pantheon: "Eptelenic"
 desc_eptelon_pantheon: "The Eptelenic religion does not preach a universal truth or promise salvation to the entire world; it is only concerned with the island of Eptelon and its inhabitants. Because of its insular nature, many foreigners have completely ignored the Eptelenic religion, and perhaps with good reason, but the Eptelenic faithful see no reason to abandon the gods that protect their sacred island."

 mother_warrior_pantheon: "Madreic"
 desc_mother_warrior_pantheon: "Those who call themselves Madreic have surrendered their lives to the worship of the Mother Warrior and will spend the rest of their days fighting to serve the divine will. A religion of strength and glory, Madreic is often favored by those that join military orders, and many Knights secretly carry the sign of the Mother Warrior against their chests."

 light_religion: "Luminist"
 desc_light_religion: "The Luminist Faith is a religion of light, of purity, of the overwhelming brightness of Truth in a world polluted by Lies and Darkness. The Light that the Luminists worship is a purifying fire that burns away the scales covering the eyes of the unbelievers, allowing them to stare into the Universal Light."

 kinone_pantheon: "Kino"
 desc_kinone_pantheon: "The religion of the Kinones is based on the teachings of the twelve prophets, or Tonkon, and the worship of Kon. The writings of the prophets reflect the generous and altruistic nature of their people. Their various religious texts speak out against the cruelty of serfdom and slavery, preaching that no man is better than any other, but that all are equal in the eyes of Kon."

 hortenic_pantheon: "Hortenic"
 desc_hortenic_pantheon: "The ancient faith of the Hortenic people is as grim and humorless as its inhabitants, and its sacred texts are mostly filled with fearsome imagery of never-ending blizzards, frozen hells with howling winds, and demons made of ice. It is no wonder that most of the Horteonians abandoned their traditional ways after they invaded the southern islands, although some back home still follow the old Hortenic rites."

 zorg_religion: "Zorganite"
 zorg_religion_desc: "The mysterious religion of the Zorg is not possible to comprehend for most in Omniluxia; to many it would seem as if the Zorg have no religious practices at all. It is all but impossible to find out for sure, though, as anyone close enough to communicate with the Zorg does not last long; inevitably, they too become Zorg."
