 celtic_philosophy:1 "Celtican Traditions"
 celtic_philosophydesc:3 "The Barbarian Traditions encompass the fighting styles of the peoples of the scattered tribes of the Celtican. They mostly relied on large formations of lightly armored infantry equipped with spears or swords, supported by nimble chariot formations or light cavalry, and made extensive use of ambush tactics, especially in forests.\n\nCan unlock the '#Y Raise Levies#!'

 celtic_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "Chariot Culture"
 celtic_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "The use of chariots in warfare stems back many thousands of years, and holds strong affiliations with nobility and class; chariot inhumations speak to the honor that can be won through battle. Chariots themselves were commonly used as mobile platforms with two to three occupants, from which javelins or other thrown weapons were used to break the ranks of their opponents."
 #Britannic
 celtic_britannic_path_1:0 "Scythed Chariots"
 celtic_britannic_path_1_desc:0 "Affixing scything blades to the wheels of our chariots, adds a lethal deterrent to anyone foolhardy enough to assault them."
 celtic_britannic_path_2:0 "Coming of Age"
 celtic_britannic_path_2_desc:0 "From a young age, our children are taught that they may be called upon to defend their settlements. If every man bears responsibility for arming himself, armies can be raised from the very salt of the earth."
 celtic_britannic_path_3:0 "Living off the Land"
 celtic_britannic_path_3_desc:0 "Our people know the ways of the land better than most; which berries and plants are edible, and which natural remedies can be used to salve wounds."
 celtic_britannic_path_4:0 "Word of Mouth"
 celtic_britannic_path_4_desc:0 "Whether it be a chance for glory, an opportunity for loot, or merely to revel in the slaughter, news of an imminent battle draws even the elders to our ranks."
 celtic_britannic_path_5:0 "Chariot Mastery"
 celtic_britannic_path_5_desc:0 "The terror inspired by a massed chariot attack, can be sufficient to break even the most battle-hardened formations."
 celtic_britannic_path_6:0 "Selective Breeding"
 celtic_britannic_path_6_desc:0 "Revered throughout the bronze age and before, as evident in the chalk hill carvings throughout Britain, the strong-backed domestic horse is a result of thousands of years of selective breeding, and capable of carrying a single rider into battle."
 celtic_britannic_path_7:0 "Take up Arms"
 celtic_britannic_path_7_desc:0 "Every man has a place in our armies; not least the hunters, who stalk their prey on battlefield and forest alike."
 celtic_britannic_path_end_bonus:0 "Trained Cavalry"
 celtic_britannic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Domestic horses, while sufficient for defense in emergencies, are inclined to panic on the battlefield. Thus, by expanding our stock of horses bred and trained for war, our bold warriors will excel at their true purpose: carnage."
 #Germanic
 celtic_germanic_path_1:0 "Strike and Withdraw"
 celtic_germanic_path_1_desc:0 "The relative fitness of our warriors, combined with our people's contempt for cumbersome equipment, allows us to outmaneuver traditional armies with ease. By harrying our opponents' flanks, they will likely lose enthusiasm for the fight before we do."
 celtic_germanic_path_2:0 "Natural Resources"
 celtic_germanic_path_2_desc:0 "The abundance of arable land and vast tracts of land sporting workable wood, give us unparalleled access to the resources we need to create weapons of war."
 celtic_germanic_path_3:0 "Ambush"
 celtic_germanic_path_3_desc:0 "'Quintili Vare, legiones redde!' - The battle of Teutoberg Forest was a decisive victory for the Germanic tribes, all but wiping out three entire Roman legions. While a combination of factors contributed to this, the Germanic familiarity with the dense terrain was a major one."
 celtic_germanic_path_4:0 "The Glory of the Hunt"
 celtic_germanic_path_4_desc:0 "Tribal warfare is a brutal affair. The seizure of slaves, women and valuables is a time-honored practice which we ought not to forgo."
 celtic_germanic_path_5:0 "Shield Wall"
 celtic_germanic_path_5_desc:0 "Germanic troops often surprised their opponents by utilizing a core of heavily shielded warriors, acting as a deterrent to attackers, and as a particularly cohesive and mobile unit on the battlefield."
 celtic_germanic_path_6:0 "The Young Must Serve"
 celtic_germanic_path_6_desc:0 "Learning the art of warfare is a vital part of every youth's education. If a child can wield a sword and maintain their equipment, then they are ready for war."
 celtic_germanic_path_7:0 "Hail of Stones"
 celtic_germanic_path_7_desc:0 "Those unable or unwilling to hold an axe, learn the art of the sling, or bow. A simple tool it may seem, but even mighty giants can be felled by a single stone."
 celtic_germanic_path_end_bonus:0 "Adaptability"
 celtic_germanic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Our brave soldiers may be the fiercest the world has seen, but true humility comes in learning from our defeats.

 #Gallic
 celtic_gallic_path_1:0 "Strike From Afar"
 celtic_gallic_path_1_desc:0 "Huntsmen and skirmishers practice from a young age, honing their skills on wildlife and those unlucky enough to constitute a target."
 celtic_gallic_path_2:0 "Confederations"
 celtic_gallic_path_2_desc:0 "Many tribes maintained close relations with their neighbors, guaranteeing a certain amount of cooperation when it came to battle. Warbands likely comprised members of many different local tribes, all fighting for glory."
 celtic_gallic_path_3:0 "The Plains Fight With us"
 celtic_gallic_path_3_desc:0 "The rolling plains of our homeland, from the coast to the mountains, prove ideal terrain for the use of cavalry."

 celtic_gallic_path_5:0 "A People on the Move"
 celtic_gallic_path_5_desc:0 "Our ancestors moved freely, uncaring of borders or territorial claims. These nomadic traditions live on, as our people live in constant readiness to seek out pastures greener than their own."
 celtic_gallic_path_6:0 "Strong Arm"
 celtic_gallic_path_6_desc:0 "While most of our warriors eschew the protection afforded by mail, our strong-armed and well equipped javelin-throwers clad themselves in armor, and can hurl iron-tipped spears capable of punching through plate armor, flesh, and bone."
 celtic_gallic_path_7:0 "Scale the Walls!"
 celtic_gallic_path_7_desc:1 "Our people have taken to residing in walled territories, which, while well-defended, have weaknesses, if one knows where to look."
 celtic_gallic_path_end_bonus:0 "Blow the Trumpet, in the New Moon!"
 celtic_gallic_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The Carnyx, a trumpet possessed of a harsh and instantly recognizable timbre, inspires our troops, while terrifying our opponents."

 greek_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "Modernized Phalanx"
 greek_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "Whilst partially responsible for the success of Alexander against the hosts of Darius the Third, the phalanx originally evolved out of the need for a highly defensive, armored formation, used by Greek city-states making war upon one another."
 #Seleucid
 greek_seleucid_path_1:0 "Agema"
 greek_seleucid_path_1_desc:0 "The Guard Cavalry formed a cadre of mounted warriors, who held the utmost respect and admiration for their King. It is said they are glad to lay down their lives in service of their overlord."
 greek_seleucid_path_2:0 "Arms for Hire"
 greek_seleucid_path_2_desc:1 "The Diadochi, despite, or perhaps due to their fractious bickering, were possessed of wealth beyond the dreams of most nascent monarchs. As such, mercenary cohorts were often available in the regions around these Greek despots."
 greek_seleucid_path_3:0 "Phoenician Sailors"
 greek_seleucid_path_3_desc:0 "The phoenicians forged an empire on the waves many centuries before Alexander's conquests. Encouraging their sailors to work for us is sure to give us an edge in naval warfare."
 greek_seleucid_path_4:0 "The Companion Cavalry"
 greek_seleucid_path_4_desc:0 "The Hetairoi were originally a Macedonian noble force, who pioneered the use of brute, shock charges. The Hetairoi were transplanted into various states, but retained their prestige as feared shock troops."
 greek_seleucid_path_5:0 "Kataphraktoi"
 greek_seleucid_path_5_desc:0 "Astride monstrous warhorses, and clad in near-impenetrable armor, the Cataphracts were an expensive form of cavalry, which excelled at punching through similarly heavy armor with their strong lances."
 greek_seleucid_path_6:0 "Thyreophoroi"
 greek_seleucid_path_6_desc:0 "These lightly armored infantry were recognizable by the Thureos, a distinctive manner of shield, and were amongst the most mobile of the Greek troops."
 greek_seleucid_path_7:0 "The Hipparchos"
 greek_seleucid_path_7_desc:0 "Often a charismatic and skilled general, a Hipparchos commanded a large unit of varying types of cavalry, often proscribing formational details down to a very fine degree."
 greek_seleucid_path_end_bonus:0 "Deep Coffers"
 greek_seleucid_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Efficient and swift payment will always attract mercenaries, perhaps even willing to work for less than their neighbors."

 greek_naval_heritage_desc:0 "Throughout the centuries Greek sailors have mastered the fickle mediterranean sea, as traders, soldiers and colonizers."
 #Greek States/Macedonia
 greek_states_path_1:0 "The Sarissa"
 greek_states_path_1_desc:0 "Phalangites, armed with a buckler, and a spear known as a sarissa, made of the core of the late Greek phalanx. The superior range of the sarissa made getting close to this formation a particularly deadly task."
 greek_states_path_2:0 "Tarentine Advance"
 greek_states_path_2_desc:0 "The Tarentine cavalry, an elite group of mercenaries originating from Tarentum, utilized very unorthodox skirmishing tactics, which were adopted throughout the Hellenistic world."
 greek_states_path_3:0 "Siegecraft"
 greek_states_path_3_desc:0 "Nobody can claim to be masters of siegecraft as much as the Greeks. During the siege of Rhodes, and many years later in Thebes, vast siege towers known as Helepoli were deployed to attempt to bypass the formidable walls of these cities entirely. It is said that the Colossus of Rhodes itself was built using material from the abandoned siege engines of Demetrios."
 greek_states_path_4:0 "Military Colonies"
 greek_states_path_4_desc:0 "A time honored way of ensuring that loyal troops were available, and justly rewarded, plots of land were granted to native greek soldiers known as cleruchs, in return for their service in the military."
 greek_states_path_5:0 "Mine's Bigger Than Yours"
 greek_states_path_5_desc:0 "For hundreds of years, the Hellenistic kingdoms attempted to outdo one another with larger and larger ships. From the huge Quadrireme, a staple warship of Monophthalmos' navies; to the gargantuan Tesserakonteres, a dual-hulled monstrosity rumored to require a crew of at least 4000, the skills of the Greek shipwrights is unmatched throughout the Hellenistic world."
 greek_states_path_6:0 "City State Fortifications"
 greek_states_path_6_desc:0 "Centuries of infighting between Greek cities naturally resulted in the erection of numerous walls, towers and fortifications, designed to keep marauding armies at bay. The stonework required to develop such comprehensive structures is a testament to the master masons."

 #Antigonid
 greek_antigonid_path_1:0 "Veterans of the Great Campaign"

 greek_antigonid_path_2:0 "Proud Shipwrights"

 greek_antigonid_path_3_desc:0 "Those of wealthy, fortunate, or noble birth learn their skills in horsemanship at a young age, often riding as a sport, as well as during warfare."
 greek_antigonid_path_4:0 "The Victor's Spoils"
 greek_antigonid_path_4_desc:1 "Cities during the early Hellenistic era would often spar over the slightest of insults. Due to such frequent battles, wars between states resulted in a style of warfare which yielded the lowest number of casualties, but highest number of prisoners. The victor would then keep them as slaves, or ransom them back to their opponents for a hefty fee."
 greek_antigonid_path_5:0 "Peltasts"
 greek_antigonid_path_5_desc:0 "Ostensibly used as skirmishing troops, the Thracian peltast was equipped with a small shield, and a series of javelins. Later, peltasts were sought after as mercenaries, by many warring states."
 greek_antigonid_path_6:0 "Specialist Infantry"
 greek_antigonid_path_6_desc:0 "Archery and the use of the sling was minor in the Hellenistic period, although the bespoke lead pellets employed by slingers acted as a formidable deterrent to enemy troops. Cretan archers were widely regarded as the best in their field."
 greek_antigonid_path_7:0 "Mastery of the Mountains"
 greek_antigonid_path_7_desc:0 "The soaring mountain ranges of central Greece have taught our people the fickle ways of doing battle in adverse terrain."

 #####Latin Traditions

 latin_philosophy:1 "Roman Traditions"
 latin_philosophydesc:3 "The Italic Traditions represent the focus on heavily armored and disciplined infantry found in the Etruscan, Roman and other Latin states. They came to favor the sword over the spear, and relied on quickly closing ground with and dispersing less well equipped infantry using strict formations, such as the Triplex Acies, with supporting light cavalry and skirmishers.\n\nCan unlock the '#Y Triplex Acies#!'

 #Latin Tribal Path
 latin_tribal_path_1:0 "Artisanal Bronzework"
 latin_tribal_path_1_desc:0 "Even after the advent of iron-working, magnificent bronze shields, spears, and helmets of all kind, pour from the forges of nascent Italic civilizations. Even tribal cultures possessed a mixture of potent bronze and iron equipment, rendering them a fearsome sight to behold."
 latin_tribal_path_2:0 "The Equestrian Order"
 latin_tribal_path_2_desc:0 "In Rome, the equites constituted an entire sub-class of patricians; wealthy aristocracy whose holdings indicated their prestige. As such, the superior wealth and training of the equites afforded them the liability to serve in the exclusive cavalry contingent of the republic's forces. Elsewhere in the Italic world, warhorses were regarded as the domain of the elite, the horses themselves often being laid to rest alongside their earthly masters in the event of their death."
 latin_tribal_path_3:1 "Pietas"
 latin_tribal_path_3_desc:0 "Relying on the devoutness of their own soldiers, and that of their opponents, the Etruscan forces are reputed to have used their priestly orders to curse their foes in plain sight, causing them to rout. In any event, the peoples of ancient Italy left nothing to chance; proper obeisance was made to the gods, before each battle was made."
 latin_tribal_path_4:0 "The Acquisition of Wealth"
 latin_tribal_path_4_desc:0 "Italic tribal cultures, and the nascent Roman Republic all engaged in the practices of raiding, pillaging, and piracy, at times. From the mythical rape of the Sabine women, to the siege of Veii, instances of looting are present throughout the history of Italy."
 latin_tribal_path_5:0 "The Aulos"
 latin_tribal_path_5_desc:0 "Numerous musical instruments are depicted in Etruscan art, but none more mysterious than the Aulos. Originally a Greek invention, the signature double-reed and pipes would have been heard accompanying all manner of occasion, perhaps even lifting soldiers' spirits on the eve before battle."
 latin_tribal_path_6:0 "Mare Nostrum"
 latin_tribal_path_6_desc:0 "The coast played a huge part in the economic life of Italy. Ships, and viable control over the locality, were vital for the continuation of prosperity in every nascent state. Skilled shipwrights, cheap labor, and abundant building material could be found in all Mediterranean harbors."
 latin_tribal_path_7:0 "Rousing Oratory"
 latin_tribal_path_7_desc:0 "The popularity of the Hellenic model of democracy spearheaded the empowerment of populist sentiment throughout a land hungry for rights. A skilled orator could sway entire cities in support of his or her cause, which could, at times, be useful."
 latin_tribal_path_end_bonus:0 "Hill Dwellers"
 latin_tribal_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Hills and mountains are an ever-present feature of life. It might be said that our armies are more accustomed than most, to the foot-slogging associated with fighting in adverse conditions."
 #Latin Support Path
 latin_support_path_1:0 "State Navy"
 latin_support_path_1_desc:0 "The enthusiasm for naval dominance is a policy that must be pursued at a state level."
 latin_support_path_2:0 "The Fabri"
 latin_support_path_2_desc:0 "The military engineers of the Omniluxian armies are responsible for the design of military structures, as well as the logistical duties associated with organizing their construction."
 latin_support_path_3:0 "Scale the Walls"
 latin_support_path_3_desc:0 "Siege engines were scarcely used in the early Republic, sieges instead relying on covert attempts to scale the walls as well as sieges of attrition. During the siege of Veii, around 396 BC, the Roman engineers reputedly proved their worth by boring a great tunnel beneath the walls of the Etruscan city, breaking the siege once and for all."
 latin_support_path_4:0 "Castra"
 latin_support_path_4_desc:0 "Cohorts, and later legions, were adept at constructing temporary; and in many cases permanent, fortresses, which served as resupply depots, rallying points, or as bases to extend a zone of military control over an unpacified area."
 latin_support_path_5:0 "Logistics of State"
 latin_support_path_5_desc:0 "As the Roman military expanded, the practice of each soldier providing his own weapons became unsustainable. Thus, by instituting a chain of supply, from natural resources, to blacksmith, to the hands of her soldiers, Rome fueled her war machine with ease."
 latin_support_path_6:0 "Scutum"
 latin_support_path_6_desc:0 "Adopting the iconic shield, the scutum, alongside the development of the manipular system, gave Rome a decisive advantage over her local enemies. Subsequently, the scutum became almost a national icon for the Romans; the very presence of a Roman shield wall was often enough to win a battle before it started."
 latin_support_path_7:0 "Foederati"
 latin_support_path_7_desc:0 "Rome's primary source of cavalry in the mid-republic, had shifted from the equites to mercenaries and allied states. This allowed a diverse array of styles and abilities to be incorporated into the ever-growing Roman military."
 latin_support_path_end_bonus:0 "Rome, Ascendant"
 latin_support_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "After a great victory, Roman custom dictated that honor be paid to the responsible commander. Lavish celebrations, often encompassing athletic events, feasts, and processions, would occupy the city for days - reinforcing in friend and foe alike, the might of Rome."
 #Roman Path
 latin_roman_path_1:0 "Principes"
 latin_roman_path_1_desc:0 "Veteran warriors all, the wealthy Principes sported heavy armor, and fought in tight-knit maniples, making excellent line troops."
 latin_roman_path_end_bonus:0 "March of the Eagles"
 latin_roman_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Irrespective of victory or defeat, as long as the eagle stands proud, the spirit of Rome imbues all her sons."
 latin_roman_path_3:0 "Triarii"
 latin_roman_path_3_desc:0 "It is said that Rome's opponents know the end is near when the Triarii lead the charge. Often used to rout an already exhausted foe, the Triarii were equipped with huge spears known as hasta, capable of punching through light armor."
 latin_roman_path_4:0 "Roman Roads"
 latin_roman_path_4_desc:0 "Often credited with winning entire wars, the practice of using the military to build roads, both in peace time and in conflict, was literally world-shaping."
 latin_roman_path_5:0 "Professional Soldiers"
 latin_roman_path_5_desc:0 "The evolution of a levied fighting force into a professional standing army, paid dividends in terms of quality and expectation. The salaried soldier was much less likely to baulk at orders, or flee from combat."
 latin_roman_path_6:0 "Velites"
 latin_roman_path_6_desc:0 "Comprised predominantly of young, unproven soldiers, the velites were light troops which fell outside the standard army organisation, instead acting as mobile skirmishers. The Velites are said to have sought glory and recognition by their daredevil acts during battle."
 latin_roman_path_7:0 "The Honor of Service"
 latin_roman_path_7_desc:0 "As Rome grew in stature, military service became a matter of honor for young Roman men. Indeed, even after defeats as humiliating as the Battle of Cannae, in which up to 80,000 of Rome's soldiers were reportedly killed, the efforts of the senate were able to raise enough soldiers to take the places of the fallen."
 latin_roman_path_2:0 "Triplex Acies"
 latin_roman_path_2_desc:0 "The triple battle line was a manipular formation, primarily utilizing the Principes, Triarii and Hastati, with the Velites in freeform support. This highly flexible formation relied on the absolute discipline of each soldier, who had to know his place amidst the chaos of battle. In extreme circumstances, the Triplex was said to have reached over a mile long."

 levantine_greco_path_2_desc:0 "Capable of working in the phalanx style, the so-called 'Swords of the Desert' were often better equipped than their counterpart, the 'Sand Spears', but were still used as a bridge between the heavier fighting men, and light, agile skirmishers."
 levantine_greco_path_3:0 "Sons of Tariku"
 levantine_greco_path_3_desc:0 "Native Egyptian soldiers played little part in the Ptolemaic army, until the formation of the 'Chosen Machimoi', after manpower concerns were raised.

 levantine_greco_path_4:0 "Baetep Warfare"
 levantine_greco_path_4_desc:0 "As with the other Empires of pre-Collapse Omniluxia, the phalanx made up the core of the Baetep army. Comprised of varying unit-types, the core principle was the same as inherited from the Zanisite reformation of the style, many decades previously."

 levantine_greco_path_6_desc:0 "The Ptolemaic navy was consistently in a process of development, not least due to the difficulty of obtaining appropriate building material. That said, the smaller ships of the Ptolemaios' could hold their own in battle, often defeating vessels much larger than themselves."
 levantine_greco_path_7:0 "Unending Riches"
 levantine_greco_path_7_desc:0 "The obscene wealth of the Ptolemaic dynasty, and the desperate need for experienced commanders, led to exorbitant sums being offered to any foreign generals who would work for them. Loyalty may be expensive, but it can be bought."
 levantine_greco_path_end_bonus:0 "Learning From the Best"
 levantine_greco_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Having seen Roman troops in action, the Seleukid and Ptolemaic dynasties attempted to mimic aspects of Roman military philosophy in their own forces. Whilst limited in success, the greater attention to mobility and flexibility must have paid dividends in many engagements."

 mauryan_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "Chariots were an essential part of life in the early period of Indian history. Whilst unsuitable for rough terrain, chariots were the domain of the nobility; even the Emperor Ashoka adopted the chariot wheel as the symbol of his Empire."
 #Mauryan
 mauryan_mauryas_path_1:0 "Versatile Infantry"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_1_desc:0 "Infantry in the Mauryan Empire were often equipped with a dazzling array of weaponry. Capable of acting as light troops one moment, to archers the next, allowed for unengaged linemen to offer ranged support in the blink of an eye."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_2:0 "Descendents of Airavata"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_2_desc:0 "Elephants had long been used for warfare by Indian states. Undomesticated, elephants tend to lead a peaceful, grazing lifestyle; however, when trained for war, the thick skinned colossi act as a living battering ram, breaking enemy infantry formations as a man might swat a fly."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_3:0 "Warhost of the Empire"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_3_desc:0 "Densely populated areas in northern India allowed for the recruitment of vast armies. The knowledge that every foot soldier is part of an invincible war-machine, inspires our troops to heroic acts of glory."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_4:0 "Natural Pathfinders"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_4_desc:0 "The overgrown jungles, and dense forests of India are perfect terrain for elephant cavalry. Able to part foliage with ease, the advantage this brings us in otherwise difficult terrain, cannot be overstated."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_5:0 "Dedicated Archers"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_5_desc:0 "The core troops of the Mauryan army were archers, armed with bows varying in style. Indeed, many Indian military formations reserve a place for a tightly packed group of well coordinated missile troops."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_6:0 "Homeland of our Fathers"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_6_desc:0 "The wild jungles and forests may have been what inspired the flexibility of the Mauryan infatrymen, who, in switching armament dependent on situation, could function just as well in low visibility, as in the open plains."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_7:0 "Integrating the Tribes"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_7_desc:0 "The systematic integration of tribal cultures into the highly efficient Mauryan bureaucracy was achieved largely by legislating them out of existence. The protection of forests, animals and royal grounds, effectively forced the tribal people to give up their nomadic way of life."
 mauryan_mauryas_path_end_bonus:0 "The Bureaucracy of War"
 mauryan_mauryas_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Used to dealing with the needs of huge armies, battles and sieges were often planned in great detail. Advance parties would often be dispatched to prepare the land for habitation, and great care was taken to protect the ubiquitous baggage train which supplied the main force."
 #Coastal
 mauryan_coastal_path_1:0 "Natural Harbors"
 mauryan_coastal_path_1_desc:0 "The coast of India was a hotbed of commerce and gossip. The numerous natural harbors led to the establishment of permanent trading posts which dealt with local and foreign tradesmen alike. The abundance of ships in need of maintenance forms a healthy competition, driving down the price of all naval endeavors."
 mauryan_coastal_path_2:0 "The Vyuha System"
 mauryan_coastal_path_2_desc:0 "The vyuha formations mentioned in the Maharabhata, placed great importance on the protection of archers. Such security will have given these troops the peace of mind to focus and perform their duties to the best of their ability."
 mauryan_coastal_path_3:0 "Masters of the Sea"
 mauryan_coastal_path_3_desc:0 "While northern India was the site of great, land-spanning Empires, the southern regions were home to kingdoms and empires which evolved gradually into significant maritime powers."
 mauryan_coastal_path_4:0 "Plunder!"
 mauryan_coastal_path_4_desc:0 "The practice of looting and pillaging was prevalent in many cultures in the ancient world, and India was no exception. The kidnap and ransom of royal persons was a major part of the dravidian kingdoms in particular."
 mauryan_coastal_path_5:0 "Flexible Divisions"
 mauryan_coastal_path_5_desc:0 "The organisation of the Mauryan army in particular, was built with flexibility in mind. The 'patti', the smallest constituent unit of troops, was unlike any other army in the world. Comprised of chariot, elephant, cavalry and infantry, it allowed for high tactical flexibility when performing formative maneuvers."
 mauryan_coastal_path_6:0 "City of the World's Desire"
 mauryan_coastal_path_6_desc:0 "Pataliputra, often considered the largest city in the ancient world, was the pinnacle of Indian architectural prowess. Elsewhere, the ability of Indian masons was displayed in the grand mountain fortifications, built to keep invaders at bay."
 mauryan_coastal_path_7:0 "State Artisans"
 mauryan_coastal_path_7_desc:0 "The supply of military equipment was, in some cases, controlled by the efficient Mauryan bureaucracy from beginning to end. In characteristic style, this highly informed manner of government reduced inefficiencies in the system, allowing for cheaper resupply."
 mauryan_coastal_path_end_bonus:0 "The 'Diplomatic' Fleet"
 mauryan_coastal_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Established by Ashoka, the presence of the state navy of the Mauryas was often enough to sway diplomacy in his favor."
 #Noble
 mauryan_noble_path_1:0 "Fit for a King"
 mauryan_noble_path_1_desc:0 "Indian chariots belonging to nobles, were often heavily ornate and formidably defended. This practice was as much a display of class, as it was a practical solution."
 mauryan_noble_path_2:0 "Trained to Kill"
 mauryan_noble_path_2_desc:0 "As well as providing an advantageous platform for a rider, war-elephants were trained to kill without a thought. An elephant charge was often enough to cause entire formations to panic."
 mauryan_noble_path_3:0 "Armored Archers"
 mauryan_noble_path_3_desc:0 "Many cultures associated archery with light, skirmishing troops. Not always so, in the Mauryan military; protecting archers against the projectiles of their enemy counterparts worked admirably in concert with the vyuha system protecting them against ground assault."
 mauryan_noble_path_4:0 "Padma Vyuha"
 mauryan_noble_path_4_desc:0 "The Padma Vyuha was a signature formation, said to resemble a lotus in bloom. The mythical origins of the Padma Vyuha are mentioned in the Maharabhata, however, the formation itself had only very limited uses."
 mauryan_noble_path_5:0 "Imported Horses"
 mauryan_noble_path_5_desc:0 "The trade in trained warhorses is vital to our success in mounted warfare. These sturdy creatures are capable of pulling enhanced weight, and are unlikely to panic in battle."
 mauryan_noble_path_6:0 "Elephantine Abundance"
 mauryan_noble_path_6_desc:0 "The green, arable land of the north is overflowing with riches, not least in the valuable elephants which are so important to our armies; and where there is a surfeit, prices drop."
 mauryan_noble_path_7:0 "Exotic Soldiers"
 mauryan_noble_path_7_desc:0 "The few soldiers from far off lands who are willing to make the journey to our realm shall find a place in our forces... after negotiation, of course."
 mauryan_noble_path_end_bonus:0 "Striding Beside Giants"
 mauryan_noble_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The effect of war-elephants is not solely reserved for our foes. Entering battle alongside such majestic creatures is a boost to the confidence of all our soldiers."

 north_african_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "Seafaring People"
 north_african_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "Civilization in North Africa has long been tied to the coastal regions. The harsh Sahara desert precludes large-scale habitation, and so, our people have long used the fickle ocean as a medium of transportation."
 #Tribal 
 north_african_tribal_path_1:0 "Born in the Saddle"
 north_african_tribal_path_1_desc:0 "The Berber people to the west, and the Numidians, learn their horsemanship at a young age. For a people always on the move, this skill is invaluable."
 north_african_tribal_path_2:0 "Man and Horse"
 north_african_tribal_path_2_desc:0 "Generations of interdependency between horse, camel, and man, allow us to get the most out of our mounted warriors, without ever pushing them too far."
 north_african_tribal_path_3:0 "Sure-footed, as Wild Horses"
 north_african_tribal_path_3_desc:0 "We have no need for theft or ownership, but live in harmony with the land around us. Where the oases and watering holes are, there will we find the wild beasts which will bear our armies."
 north_african_tribal_path_4:0 "Wild Charge"
 north_african_tribal_path_4_desc:0 "To some, it may seem like a disordered, chaotic melee, yet our warriors revel in this battle dance, knowing the movements of friend and foe, and acting as one with the rhythm of war."
 north_african_tribal_path_5:0 "Local Knowledge"
 north_african_tribal_path_5_desc:0 "None know better than our people, the ways of the desert. Where others see a desolate plain, we see potential."
 north_african_tribal_path_6:0 "Call to Arms"
 north_african_tribal_path_6_desc:0 "The fortunes of our people are called into question every time we are threatened - all must rise in defense of our culture. We live, or die, as one."
 north_african_tribal_path_7:0 "Ululating Cry"
 north_african_tribal_path_7_desc:0 "A single war cry on the lips of every one of our soldiers. This is the way of our people, and the way in which we will show our foes that we stand united, and ready to kill."
 north_african_tribal_path_end_bonus:0 "To Each, Their Own"
 north_african_tribal_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "We impose no strictures on our tribal people. They come and go as they please, often bringing their spoils with them."
 #Naval
 north_african_naval_path_1:0 "Phoenician Heritage"
 north_african_naval_path_1_desc:0 "The ancient traders of Tyre settled tracts of land across the Mediterranean. Their legendary seafaring skills live on in the memory of our people."
 north_african_naval_path_2:0 "Iberian Draft"
 north_african_naval_path_2_desc:0 "Carthage, in an attempt to counter the lack of available troops associated with their sprawling, decentralized empire, employed vast quantities of foreign soldiers. The fierce Iberians made a valuable addition to their ranks."
 north_african_naval_path_3:0 "Naval Dominance"
 north_african_naval_path_3_desc:0 "The Carthaginian fleet was a constant presence in the seas around Sicily and North Africa. The safety and reassurance this provides our crews cannot be understated, leading to a calm knowledge of our superiority in this theater."
 north_african_naval_path_4:0 "A Life at Sea"
 north_african_naval_path_4_desc:0 "While some nations build bespoke fleets for tackling particular enemies, our navy is in constant use. As such, our ships always carry supplies to perform maintenance in-situ, making it much easier to recover from combat or general attrition."
 north_african_naval_path_5:0 "Noble Warlords"
 north_african_naval_path_5_desc:0 "The noble heritage of our people lives on in our practice of appointing the elite to lead our men. Those with so much invested into our nation are hard to sway with offers of gold or land."
 north_african_naval_path_6:0 "Imposing Edifices"
 north_african_naval_path_6_desc:0 "The lighthouses, civic structures, and fortifications of our people are recognizable to all who enter our lands. The imposing walls of our cities, however, give pause for thought to those who enter with a mind for conquest."
 north_african_naval_path_7:0 "Putting our People to Work"
 north_african_naval_path_7_desc:0 "The reliance of the Carthaginian army on foreign soldiers, was not mirrored in the navy. The poor or disillusioned could always find cheap labor at sea, manning one of the many military vessels of the Carthaginian state."
 north_african_naval_path_end_bonus:0 "Maneuverability Above All"
 north_african_naval_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The Greek penchant for huge ships was not shared by the Carthaginians. Experts in naval warfare, they favored smaller craft with enhanced adaptability, leading to numerous victories over their enemies. The Battle of Catana in 397 BC resulted in a crushing defeat for the Syracusan forces, who were outnumbered and outperformed by the Carthaginian armada."
 #Army
 north_african_army_path_1:0 "Skilled Recruiters"
 north_african_army_path_1_desc:0 "Unable to supply enough fit soldiers for the needs of the state, Carthage resorted to employing all manner of foreign mercenaries in their army. Relying on the skill of their negotiators, Carthage became the first port of call for soldiers seeking paid employment."
 north_african_army_path_2:0 "Professional Marines"
 north_african_army_path_2_desc:0 "Ships in the Carthaginian navy were outfitted not only with a crew of sailors, but a crew of battle-hardened marines. Boarding action was common in antiquity, and the presence of a cadre of armed men must surely have put the minds of sailors and oarsmen at rest."
 north_african_army_path_3:0 "The Sacred Band"
 north_african_army_path_3_desc:0 "Unlike the rest of the predominantly mercenary forces, the Sacred Band were a group of Carthaginian citizens, possibly of noble birth, armed and equipped with heavy armor and spears. This elite group operated in a similar style to the Greek phalanxes, but due to their small number, were destroyed and reformed on several occasions throughout Carthaginian history."
 north_african_army_path_4:0 "Uneasy Relations"
 north_african_army_path_4_desc:0 "The supply of troops to our armies by countries willing to pay, can have implications. Our nation could even be held to ransom by those unwilling to provide the necessary forces - this must not be permitted."
 north_african_army_path_5:0 "The African Elephant"
 north_african_army_path_5_desc:0 "Immense beasts with thick skin and a variable temperament, elephants were utilized as shock cavalry in the Carthaginian army. As proven by Hannibal's crossing of the alps, they made excellent pack animals when not engaged in combat."
 north_african_army_path_6:0 "Numidian Cavalry"
 north_african_army_path_6_desc:0 "The interior of Africa provides skilled riders, the likes of which our foes cannot match. Combined with our superior equipment, we can transform these nomadic warriors into fearsome heavy cavalry."
 north_african_army_path_7:0 "Devastating Charge"
 north_african_army_path_7_desc:0 "The psychological effect of elephants on the battlefield was huge. Battle lines would break, men were trampled, and entire armies would surrender at the dust clouds created by an approaching army with an elephant contingent."
 north_african_army_path_end_bonus:0 "A Hard Bargain"
 north_african_army_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "Many nations were considered protectorates by Carthage, often providing troops in return for nominal protection. Whilst they were paid, this expectation of service drives down the costs compared with regular mercenary contracts."

 persian_philosophy_start_bonus:0 "Scythian Horse Archers"
 persian_philosophy_start_bonus_desc:0 "Strong-backed Scythian horses have been used by the nomadic tribes of the steppe for generations. Unparalleled as skirmishing troops, the chaos they could incur was a major advantage to thsoe lucky enough to be able to raise or hire them."
 #Scythian Path
 persian_scythian_path_1:0 "The Parthian Shot"
 persian_scythian_path_1_desc:0 "The signature tactic of horse archers was the Parthian Shot. Requiring utter mastery over their steeds, the riders would retreat from their foe, and by twisting their bodies in the saddle, would fire back at their target."
 persian_scythian_path_2:0 "Nomadic Lifestyle"
 persian_scythian_path_2_desc:0 "The people of the steppe are often on the move. Their constant readiness is quite a boon when making war."
 persian_scythian_path_3:0 "Hit and Run"
 persian_scythian_path_3_desc:0 "Contrary to the formative tactics associated with infantry, cavalry tactics tended to involve much more individual autonomy. None more so than horse archers, who would create a swirling cloud of arrows and horses, demoralizing enemy formations, and giving an advantage to the subsequent pitched engagement."
 persian_scythian_path_4:0 "Cavalry Skirmish"
 persian_scythian_path_4_desc:0 "Cavalry make for excellent interceptors, cutting off routes of retreat, and interfering with supply lines. By ordering our riders to harass but never definitively engage, we deny our foes the convenience of a numerical advantage."
 persian_scythian_path_5:0 "Cataphracts"
 persian_scythian_path_5_desc:0 "Many cultures with a history of equine mastery developed usage of heavy cavalry, or cataphracts, as a means of countering small arms. With both horse and rider clad in heavy scale or mail, nothing short of total rout would break the charge of a unit of cataphracts."
 persian_scythian_path_6:0 "Steppe Mastery"
 persian_scythian_path_6_desc:0 "The nomadic lifestyle instills our people with an excellent knowledge of how to act and survive in this harsh terrain."
 persian_scythian_path_7:0 "Footsloggers"
 persian_scythian_path_7_desc:0 "While the majority of steppe warfare was mounted, scythian infantry are reported in numerous engagements in mid-antiquity. The Battle of Thatis saw the use of a large Siracian contingent of infantry, warring against the early Bosporan kingdom."
 persian_scythian_path_end_bonus:0 "Born to Ride"
 persian_scythian_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The Sarmatian and Scythian tribes learn their horsemanship from a young age, developing an affinity for the saddle unlike any western culture. This knowledge can be put to good practical use when organizing our armies."
 #Achaemenid (native Persian)
 persian_achaemenid_path_1:0 "Legacy of Cyrus"
 persian_achaemenid_path_1_desc:0 "The huge hosts of the Achaemenid empire instilled the Hellenic civilizations to the west with the utmost fear. The vast territory controlled by his empire, and the willingness of his people to serve, guaranteed a high throughput of soldiers."
 persian_achaemenid_path_2:0 "The Immortals"
 persian_achaemenid_path_2_desc:0 "A legendary unit of soldiers known as the Immortals, supposedly named due to the constant size of the unit at 10,000 strong, the Immortals utilized a diverse array of weaponry, and heavy armor, providing a backbone of heavy infantry around which the rest of the army was formed."
 persian_achaemenid_path_3:0 "Reform of the Navy"
 persian_achaemenid_path_3_desc:0 "The Achaemenid dynasty oversaw the implementation of a navy in Persia, drawing on the nearby Phoenician mariners to crew it. Such a legacy of naval tradition still imbues our people."
 persian_achaemenid_path_4:0 "Reactive Recruitment"
 persian_achaemenid_path_4_desc:0 "The vast hosts of ancient Persian kings are mentioned in numerous sources. The act of levying local men of fighting age must have contributed significantly to the dazzling size of the warhosts raised."
 persian_achaemenid_path_5:0 "Royal Line"
 persian_achaemenid_path_5_desc:0 "The Achaemenid line ran, unbroken from Cyrus to the fall of the Empire at the hands of Alexander the Great. Despite the recent subjujation, the glory days of the Persian empire remains strong and within living memory."
 persian_achaemenid_path_6:0 "To Blot Out the Sun"
 persian_achaemenid_path_6_desc:0 "Praised for their prowess in archery by Herodotus, Achaemenid soldiers made use of the ubiquitous composite bow. In the famous Battle of Thermopylae, the sheer quantity of archers used by the native Persian troops were said to be able to blot out the very sun itself."
 persian_achaemenid_path_7:0 "Kardakes"
 persian_achaemenid_path_7_desc:0 "Latterly, the Persians relied on heavily armored mercenary infantry known as the Kardakes. Present during Alexander's invasion, they were recruited from Persian lands, but employed as cheap mercenaries."

 persian_achaemenid_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The sheer quantity of our troops can overwhelm any pitiful resistance. The cost in lives may be high, but the victory is made all the sweeter for it."
 #Bactrian
 persian_bactrian_path_1:0 "Bactrian Horsemen"
 persian_bactrian_path_1_desc:0 "Both the Achaemenids and the Macedonians used Bactrian horsemen in their forces, due to their skill and availability. Like the western Scythians, their culture was heavily influenced by an equine nomadic lifestyle."
 persian_bactrian_path_2:0 "Greco-Bactria"
 persian_bactrian_path_2_desc:0 "The Greek influences on Bactria took hold unusually swiftly. Architecture and fortifications sprang up in these styles, often regarded as superior to their less hellenized neighbors."
 persian_bactrian_path_3:0 "Perfect Storm"
 persian_bactrian_path_3_desc:0 "The Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, which developed in the mid-3rd Century BC, was a cultural melting pot of styles, people, and most importantly, tactics. The fusion of these diverse ways of doing battle, made for a formidable fighting force."
 persian_bactrian_path_4:1 "Klerouchoi"
 persian_bactrian_path_4_desc:0 "The Macedonians created scores of settlements in Bactria during Alexander's conquests, many of which prospered. The Kleruchoi, as they were known, provided a loyal manpower base for generations."
 persian_bactrian_path_5:0 "Titans of Battle"
 persian_bactrian_path_5_desc:0 "The proximity to India, led to the adoption of elephants as an entire wing of the army. Riders would sit, mounted on a howdah, giving them a vantage point over the melee below."
 persian_bactrian_path_6:0 "Hippotoxotai"

 persian_bactrian_path_7:0 "Heartland"
 persian_bactrian_path_7_desc:0 "The heartland of Bactria itself was a lush, fertile plain, surrounded by mountains, steppe and desert, in all directions. The adaptability required to survive here, leads to our armies being better prepared than most."
 persian_bactrian_path_end_bonus:0 "Disillusioned Masses"
 persian_bactrian_path_end_bonus_desc:0 "The grand campaign of Alexander left behind thousands of mercenaries, willing to serve for their subsistence. Latterly, many of the surrounding tribes began to be assimilated, leading to plentiful and cheap mercenary contracts being available."
